A VOICE 
A VOICE 
              A beast! 
A bit of purgatory 'twas for this time, merely. 
A blessing drawn from supernatural fountains! 
A canine form that cannot be! 
A cavalier am I, like others in my bearing. 
A certain liquid was not drunken. 
A chain at first, then other ornament: 
A chain of deepest action forging 
A chance-dropped word may set me sweating! 
A chimney, also, you behold. 
A cloak in silken lustre swimming, 
A contradiction thus complete 
     A cross upon his breast. 
     A dissolute dream once came to me: 
A dog thou seest, and not a phantom, here! 
A draught wherefrom thy thirst forever slakes? 
A dreary light, like that of dawn! 
A face like thine beheld I never. 
A fair young damsel took him in her care, 
A faith bequeathed from Childhood's dawn, 
A fellow made of genuine flesh and blood 
A few more steps ascend, as far as yonder stone!-- 
A fine way, this, thy time to fill! 
A fine young fellow's presence, to my thinking, 
A fitter woman ne'er was made 
  A fluctuant wave, 
A friend! 
A gallant youth! has travelled far: 
A game whose winnings no man ever knew,-- 
A garter that her knee has pressed! 
A general practice is the same, 
A gift for her I bid thee get! 
"A gift-horse is not out of place, 
A girl by the nose is leading thee. 
A girl in Sunday clothes,--these three are my delights. 
A girl that takes my heart, completely. 
A glorious dream! though now the glories fade. 
        A golden goblet gave. 
A good man does his honest share 
A good man, through obscurest aspiration, 
A good reply! 
A gray and wrinkled noddy; 
A hash, a stew, will bring success, believe it! 
A heaven thy loving words expressed, 
A highly-learned man, to stray. 
  A holiday, that shows your pity, 
     A hollow thing,-- 
A horror from the vaulted roof, 
A house, a little garden near the town. 
A hundred fires along the ranks are burning. 
A hundred thousand fools in chorus. 
A knave sharp-set! 
A knock? Come in! Again my quiet broken? 
(_A knock_) 
(_A knock_). 
A little burning air, which I shall soon prepare us, 
A little creature 'twill not be, 
A little freedom and recreation. 
A little more, and they would bend the knee 
A little thievish and a little frolicsome. 
(_A lofty-arched, narrow, Gothic chamber_. FAUST, _in a chair at his 
A long, sharp sword for show or quarrel,-- 
A long-legged grasshopper appears to be, 
A look from thee, a word, more entertains 
A loss like this to death would grieve me. 
     A lovely dream once came to me; 
A maid that, even from my breast, 
A man can think and know so much? 
A man who some result intends 
A mind, once formed, is never suited after; 
     A minister's star and name; 
                  A moment, ere we part! 
A most fastidious person you appear. 
A most offensive song! Thank God, each morning, therefore, 
A nasty song! Fie! a political song-- 
A new performance--'tis the last of seven. 
A newer chorus now succeeds! 
A nice estate was left us by my father, 
A parson came, by the mother bidden: 
A poor, unknowing child! and he-- 
A question small, it seems, 
A quiet hour, to see us fondly plighted, 
     A rag will answer for a sail; 
A red mouse from her mouth--sufficient reason. 
A rogue you are, and you were always so. 
A sarcasm on the asker. 
A secret dread began to haunt her. 
A short time, only, am I here, 
A shudder, long unfelt, comes o'er me; 
  A shuttle free, 
A single hour they've not been here. 
A single scarlet band is gleaming, 
A slave am I, whate'er I do-- 
A spectre is, which all to shun endeavor. 
A splendid word to serve, you'll find 
A starveling flame, ye blow it bare! 
A streaming trail of fire, if I see rightly, 
A strong, old beer, a pipe that stings and bites, 
A stubborn bachelor there's no converting. 
A sweet, uncomprehended yearning 
A tall cock's-feather in my hat, 
A third time itching to be tried? 
A thousand germs break forth and grow, 
A title first must draw and interest them, 
     A tough old sow and the mother thereon, 
A traveller is so used to be 
A travelling scholar, then? The _casus_ is diverting. 
  A weaving, flowing 
A welcome, but also a silent, guest. 
A wild night on a wench's breast another chooses: 
A will-o'-the-wisp in murky air. 
A witches'-guild. 
A woman's form, in beauty shining! 
A word steps promptly in as deputy. 
A word, transforms thy gifts to nothingness. 
A writhing worm, a terror-stricken form?

AUERBACH'S CELLAR IN LEIPZIG 
AUTHOR 
(_A_ STUDENT _enters_.) 
Abortion, thou, of filth and fire! 
About my bet I feel no trepidation. 
Above me heaven unfurled, the floor of waves beneath me,-- 
Above the earth will nimbly bear us, 
Absurder than I ever yet did see. 
     Accurséd fere! 
Accurséd folk! How dare you venture thus? 
Adam's first wife is she. 
Address him, and he gambols straight; 
          Adieu! 
(_After the holes have been bored and plugged_) 
Again before my half-distracted senses! 
Again it seethes, again it glows! 
Again the street I see 
Again ye come, ye hovering Forms! I find ye, 
Against the rocks' deep bases hurled, 
Against the smoky paper thrust,-- 
Age childish makes, they say, but 'tis not true; 
Agreed! But 'tis a short probation. 
Ah! 
Ah! I perceive a juggler's trick. 
Ah! in the midst of it there sprang 
        Ah! to the woe of earth 
          Ah! when we would find him, 
Ah, God! another one so dear 
Ah, God! but Art is long, 
Ah, God! what hast thou done? 
Ah, bravo! Do I find you burning? 
            Ah, can I not remain? 
        Ah, dared I clasp him, 
Ah, dearest dame, let not your courage fail! 
Ah, dearest man, if but thy face I see, 
Ah, every utterance from the depths of feeling 
Ah, if I leave this spot with fond designing, 
Ah, if I only slept alone! 
Ah, know'st thou what it means? He loves thee! 
Ah, look and see--just look and see! 
Ah, me! this dungeon still I see. 
        Ah, nevermore! 
        Ah, nevermore! 
        Ah, nevermore! 
Ah, not alone the jewelry! 
        Ah, past guessing, 
                  Ah, rogue! a tease thou art: 
                Ah, shall there never be 
"Ah, still delay--thou art so fair!" 
_Ah, tara, lara da_! 
_Ah, tara, lara, da_! 
Ah, that no wing can lift me from the soil, 
Ah, that simplicity and innocence ne'er know 
Ah, the remembrance makes me die! 
Ah, those were the days of blessing! 
Ah, thought I, in my conduct has he read it-- 
Ah, when one studies thus, a prisoned creature, 
     Ah, when, within our narrow chamber 
Ah, who may all this splendor own? 
Ah, within thine arms to hide me, 
Ah, woe! thy lips are chill, 
Ah, you don't understand! 
Aha! you lick your chops, from sheer anticipation. 
Air in leaves, and wind in reed, 
Air? Light? 
Alack, that men are so unfortunate! 
Alas! in living Nature's stead, 
        Alas! my tears did wet, 
Alas! the wings that lift the mind no aid 
Alas, that trade and duty us so harry! 
All Heaven and Earth in rapture penetrating; 
All Heaven descends, and opens bright around you! 
All ages have been taught the matter,-- 
All come forth to the cheerful light. 
          All for the dance the shepherd dressed, 
     All for the distant 
All from the fellowship of fools are shrinking. 
(_All gather around him_) 
All hearts that beat beneath the heavenly day-- 
     All in the air are 
All instruments are fitting; 
     All is turning, whirling, blending, 
All movement of my life impedes? 
All rights and laws are still transmitted 
All sorts of tender rigmarole, 
All that depends on habitude. 
All that is fine and good, to hear it so: 
All that is promised shall delight thee purely; 
All that there is in Earth and Heaven, 
All the repulsive cheats I view,-- 
All times I'll have to think on you, all places! 
All unprepared, the charm I spin: 
All, all! Alas, we poor! 
Allow me that my album first I reach you,-- 
Almighty God! what misery! 
Aloft we'd fain ourselves betake. 
Alone and far, a girl most pale and fair? 
        Alone, and ah! unsleeping, 
     Alone, old Baubo's coming now; 
Along the shining path of Love? 
Along this labyrinth of vales to wander, 
(_Aloud_) 
(_Aloud_.) 
Already art thou o'er-excited, 
          Already footed it like mad: 
        Already on my bed. 
Already there, with curious eyebrows raised, 
Also be a devil. 
Also unto the Devil sticks. 
Alternately follow, as best they can: 
Always the truth establishes. 
Am I a God?--so clear mine eyes! 
Am I again so foully cheated? 
Amid thy blessed light could stand, 
Among Thy menials, now, my face Thou findest. 
Among my equals I would be. 
Among the beggars and cripples hide thee; 
Among these vales and hills surrounding, 
Among this crowd of merry folk, 
Among this witches' revelry 
Amused us hast, on the mountain's crest, 
An angel, if like thee! 
An easier space, and from the crowd be free: 
  An eternal sea, 
An offal-barrel and a lumber-garret, 
An old he-goat, from Blocksberg coming home, 
An't please thee, also I'm content to stay, 
Ancestral lumber, stuffed and packed-- 
And Dilettanti in the parts appear. 
And Honor's godlike zest, 
And I advise thee, brief and flat, 
     And I am moved with joy, to know 
And I am saved!-- 
And I am yet so young, so young! 
And I must hear, by all the living, 
And I must nurse it, warm beside me press it, 
And I shall have thee fast and sure!-- 
And I shall try to serve you nicely. 
And I should turn to better ways than flirting. 
And I think the man a knave, as I live! 
And I'd still be followed and taken! 
And I, God's hate flung o'er me, 
And I, as suits their quality, 
And I? What drew me here with power? 
And Jurisprudence, Medicine,-- 
And Life, alas! is fleeting. 
And Margaret? 
And Memory holds me now, with childish feeling, 
And Nature shuts on me her gate. 
And Nature's wise instruction seek, 
     And Reason then resumes her speech: 
And _you_ he dowers with Day and Night. 
And a bad conscience sharper misery giving! 
And a good wife, are gold and jewels worth. 
And after--first and foremost duty--Of 
And all Thy works, sublime and splendid, 
And all her crime was a delusion dear! 
And all is dissipated. 
And all of life for all mankind created 
And all strike in at each refrain! 
And all the Near and Far that he desireth 
And all the caps are lifted high; 
And all the swaggerers were dumb. 
And all thy soul's devotion swear her? 
And all you find, be sure to show it! 
And all, belonging thereunto, 
     And also all his relations 
And also made their opportunity. 
And an infinite combination grows. 
And answer "Yes" to all he says, 
And are, at once, most popular of men. 
And as a token with him bears, 
And as for Faith and Church, I grant to each his own. 
And as for bread, around a baker's door, in famine, 
And as regards the younger folk, indeed, 
And ask us how we do, in manner kindest, 
And bachelors of youth and fire. 
        And bear aloft Thy sorrow and His pain! 
And bear me forth to new and varied being! 
And bear me to her beauteous field! 
        And bitterness all. 
And blacker yet was in my will; 
And blessed myself, and boasted high,-- 
And blesses then, as home he wends 
And blest is he, who has the lucky fate, 
And bones of beasts surround me yet! 
And both your ravens, where are _they_ now? 
And both, the spheric race partaking, 
And both, tormented then by flame unsparing, 
And burning thirst again assail us? 
And by degrees your heart is tangled; 
And call it mirth, and call it song! 
And call this ardor, so supernal, 
And claims of Mother Night her ancient place. 
And clinging lust the world in its embraces; 
And come, devoted and sincere, 
And could not even eat my share in peace and quiet!" 
And cursed be Patience most of all! 
And dandling back and forth the restless creature take, 
And danger thousand-fold, our race to wrong. 
And dares not even now and then to tarry! 
     And darest not name him? 
And dash out my brains in desperation! 
And deepest sleep will on her senses sink. 
And deeply edified were they. 
And do I ask, wherefore my heart 
        And drank the last life-glow; 
     And driven at last, in open day, 
     And drop, quiescent? 
And each awaits the banquet I shall give. 
And each goes home content with the effect, 
And each withdraws from, and repels, its brother. 
And elbows planted as in boast: 
And even the fir-tree feels it now: 
And even, alas! Theology,-- 
And ever circulates a newer, fresher blood. 
     And everything fits, 
And fain would make my acquisition 
And falling, fill the hills with hollow thunders,-- 
And fancies there are no favors more, 
     And far and wide the heather press 
And feel'st not, thronging 
And fill thy goblet full and free! 
And for another keep, meanwhile, my eyes about me. 
And for the sense and power intense 
And foreign wenches and foreign wine, 
And found that heavier scores to his account were lying. 
And from my heart. 
And from the worn and fingered book 
And from your heap of ashes hatching 
And grant to these their merits, 
And grasps me now a long-unwonted yearning 
And green alone Life's golden tree. 
     And had I but gold, 
And had I not the Flame reserved, why, really, 
And half and half thou art, I own. 
And half in wrath: 
And hast on smaller scale begun. 
And hast unlearned thy kissing? 
And have a care to be most civil: 
And he deserves thy kitchen's best potation: 
And he lamented his ill fortune all the more. 
And he treated her always to pies and wine, 
And he wouldn't, else, have been so bold! 
     And he'll work himself out. 
And head and virile forces--thine: 
And heard the swagger as it rose. 
                         And heartily! 
And her head is wagging ever. 
And her to the Equator! 
And here! 
And here there hangs a key to fit: 
And here was wrought, through holier, purer presence, 
And here, on my right breast, my baby lay! 
And here, poor fool! with all my lore 
And heretofore to meet myself wert fain, 
And him, with thee, be downward led; 
          And hips and elbows straying. 
        And hold, and own! 
And home I can go without your care. 
And honestly, in his own fashion, pondered 
And hope, before my last step to the grave, 
And how the Devil jests, be now enlightened! 
        And hurled the hallowed goblet 
And if I now sit down in restful leisure, 
And if a will-o'-the-wisp must guide you on the way, 
And if no headache persecute them, 
And if that image of delight 
And if the Earth don't open now 
And if the wine be good, our praises shall be ample. 
And if thou'rt moved to speak in earnest, 
And if we were discovered by her, 
And if your acts are half discreet, 
And if, this moment, came she in to me, 
And in enjoyment pine to feel desire. 
And in his presence stifled seems my heart. 
And in its whirlpool forces us along! 
And in the grass the same old ditty sings. 
     And in the heart, itself that knows. 
And in thy lap wilt take me once again. 
     And in wildering escort gather! 
And instruments together hurled, 
And is a most eccentric chapter. 
And is as whimsical as on Creation's day. 
And is it thou? Thou, surely, certainly? 
And is not apt, without a why or wherefore, 
And it seems thou repellest my kiss: 
And it will seem a mocking play, 
And jolly rows and squabbles, trust me! 
And justly so: for all things, from the Void 
And kin of all conditions, 
        And kiss his mouth, 
And knead and shape her to your thought, 
And knowledge brings disgust unspoken. 
And knows not what she should, or will; 
And let it sparkle fresh and fine! 
And lie dissolved in dreams of love's sweet leisure! 
And lights so dimly, that, as one advances, 
And lisp like angels, when with lies they meet us. 
And little wings--we know 'em! 
     And loved him past explaining, 
And make it firmly your possession; 
And many a comrade praised to me 
And many draughts are known to him. 
And me a little away, 
And me, thou angel! didst thou recognize, 
And meanwhile thou, alone, mayst glow 
     And measure his coat, I say! 
And mix things madly through and through, 
And more than ever we must pay! 
And mother gave a loan thereon? 
And mother's case seemed hopeless quite, 
And mother, in her notions of housekeeping, 
And mother, nights, ne'er let us out the door 
And move, as we deliberately impel, 
And much could I in his face behold,-- 
And much good may the liquor do thee! 
And must I find her body, there reclining, 
And names the Good, whose cheating fortune tore them 
And neighbor trunks with crushing weight bear down, 
And never cared to have them in my keeping. 
        And never more drank he! 
And never shall I be glad again. 
And never yet complained of surfeit: 
     And nine is one, 
And none demanded: who got well? 
And not for death, indeed. 
And now Death comes, and ruin! 
And now before mine eyes expands the ocean 
And now in this, now that, the leaven works. 
And now they say I killed the child outright. 
And now you even dance, like one of us! 
And now!--I could tear my hair with vexation. 
And now, I do entreat this boon-- 
And now, away! Thou dar'st not rest. 
And now-- 
And now--a living sin am I! 
And of a noble family; 
And of the witches in the mass, 
And oft, to quiet it, my bed forsake, 
And oft, with zeal my critic-duties meeting, 
And old ones, veiled and hidden shrewdly: 
And on her neighbor try thy skill! 
        And on his kisses 
And on our heads we go, then. 
And on the Blocksberg they erect 
And one becomes the talk, do whatsoe'er one may. 
And one is almost turned to stone. 
And one keeps watch then with delight. 
And otherwise must I translate it. 
And over plains and lakes and islands 
And over the wreck-strewn gorges 
And overladen, nigh to sinking, 
And play your hocus-pocus on us! 
And plunge into the world with zest! 
And power not sees,-- 
And prayer dissolved me in a fervent bliss. 
And prospects the completest! 
And purple grapes at hand! 
And quicker yet 'tis done. 
And quickly fill the beaker to the brim! 
And rather starves or begs, than loses? 
          And rested, panting, arm in arm,-- 
     And rich thou 'It be. 
And richer far than were the old. 
And rise not, on us shining, 
And rival storms abroad are surging 
     And roll incessant: 
          And round the linden sounded wide. 
And rummage in empty words no more! 
And scents about, his track to find. 
And secretly the jewels don, 
  And see and lighten my distress! 
And see, that nothing can be known! 
And sees all sorts of ships go down the river gliding: 
And seizes me! 
And sensibler than I, you'll find. 
And serve thee in a social station; 
And shall I see--possess her? 
And shall a promise bind my being? 
And shaped and cherished--which with joy expanded, 
And she made a to-do with her face so fine; 
And she much love, much faith to him did bear, 
And she of him. So runs the world away! 
And she recovered, then, so slowly, day by day. 
And shifted round from place to place. 
And show a strapping body. 
And show that yours all other arts exceeds; 
And shows, no otherwise it could have been: 
And side-wards she, with young unwakened senses, 
And simply take your master's words for truth. 
        And sinking deep in the sea: 
And sit down on the settle! 
And smells each article, to see 
And snares the soul with visions vain; 
And so I nursed it all alone 
     And so they go over stone and stock; 
And so we'll choose ourselves a Pope. 
And so, as bachelor, into his grave a-creeping, 
    And so, at last, it serves her rightly. 
And so, but little time is needed, 
And so, though even God forgive, 
     And soon enough the poor beast had, 
And soon thou'lt be aware, with keenest thrills of pleasure, 
             And soon to meet again! 
And spare my lungs henceforth: whoever 
And spare to me the further trouble. 
     And spreading, surroundeth 
And stayed the plague in all the land. 
And stealthy, then, along the coping creeps: 
And still. 
And still, alas! the echoes first that rang! 
And stirreth not and quickens 
And straight or cross-wise, wrong or right, 
And strike them into dust! 
And stroking then my beard, I'd say, 
And such a luck from Heaven befell us, 
And such, forthwith, I'd have you brew. 
And supping there with Hans occasioned your delay? 
And surely, Henry, 'tis with thee the same. 
And sway me from your misty, shadowy zone! 
And sweet, clear echoes came, deceiving 
And swift, and swift beyond conceiving, 
And teach thy pulses of youth and pleasure 
And temper the austere delight of thought. 
     And ten is none. 
And thanked no less, and thanked no more 
And that a poodle ran away? 
And that damned stuff, the bestial, human brood,-- 
And the Good and the Beautiful vilipends, 
     And the crags above us stooping, 
And the damned throw of dice, indeed. 
And the danger to which thou wilt expose thyself? Know that the guilt of 
And the discordant tones of all existence 
     And the echoes, like traditions 
          And the fiddle-bow was playing. 
     And the fire-flies wink and darkle, 
And the garden, brightly blooming, 
And the heaviest weight to-night 
     And the lords and ladies of honor 
        And the magic flow 
And the man berate her, 
     And the new songs of cheer 
And the others are now so far ahead! 
     And the rocky snouts, outgrowing,-- 
     And the roots, like serpents twisted, 
        And the soldiers go marching, 
And the stern heart is tenderly unmanned. 
And the streets overflow: 
     And the winged races 
And then a chance will come, a holiday, 
     And then as sore oppressed was he 
And then the lofty instinct, thus-- 
And then the marketing and kitchen-tending, 
And then they draw the veil of night 
And then, as one a child's tooth draws, with cleverness, 
And then, how far his work, and grandly, we have brought. 
And then, how masterly she reads physiognomy! 
And then, observe for whom you write! 
And then, with burning sidelong glances, 
     And there two fairest apples shone: 
And there's a neat romance, completed ere you know! 
And they are bulky masses. 
     And they did not dare to brush them, 
And things, all splendid to behold, 
And think they're near the treasure: 
And this one Book of Mystery 
And this young lady will be present, too? 
And those beside, whose joy my Song so flattered, 
And thou didst kiss, as thou wouldst suffocate me-- 
And thou forgiv'st my freedom, and the blame 
And thou mine arts with joy shalt see: 
And thou remainest--what thou art. 
And though the shock of storms may smite me, 
And through thy frame the liquor's potence fling. 
And thus the bitter task forego 
And thus the pious man you see 
And thus, my own sole self to all their selves expanded, 
And thus, thou'rt prisoner to me? 
And thus, to graver paces brought, 
And thy heart 
And to subscribe thy name thou'lt take a drop of blood. 
And to the mob laid bare each thought and feeling, 
And to thine every nod obedient be: 
And towards a self-erected goal 
And treasures, buried long ago: 
And treated _your_ slips with as little heed. 
And trees that daily with new leafage clothe them! 
And truly 'tis not much, when all is done. 
And truly, song must here rebound 
     And two let be, 
And usually you're all aflame. 
And viewed it with a favor stealthy. 
And waking, hear. 
And wax and leather keep the lordship then. 
And we no less revere you for that reason: 
And we'll scatter chaff before her door! 
And weak old Winter himself must shiver, 
And what I lost, grows real and undying. 
And what in wavering apparition gleams 
And what one knows, one uses never. 
And what shall be my counter-service therefor? 
And what we should not, often did; 
And what will _you_? 
And what you'd like I'll undertake to get you. 
And what's this pot? 
And when a corpse approaches, close my house: 
And when a dozen thee have known, 
And when from these my life itself divorces, 
And when the clock strikes, be on hand! 
And when the lecture-halls receive me, 
And when the perfect moon before my gaze 
And when the storm in forests roars and grinds, 
And when thou in the feeling wholly blessed art, 
And when upon his rump the leeches hang and fuddle, 
And when your hands unroll some parchment rare and old, 
And while a thousand tears were burning, 
And who profess Him, 
     And will be broken. 
And will her foul mess take away 
And willingly a glass I'll fill him. 
And wilt thou be afraid of fire? 
          And with his elbow punched a maid, 
And with tremendous, oft-repeated urging, 
And worry and success, 
And yet 'tis not so warm outside. 
And yet 'tis thou, so good, so kind to see! 
And yet I cannot gain them here. 
And yet I'm right! 
And yet a little pert, be sure! 
And yet is never Death a wholly welcome guest. 
And yet it seemed as I were drinking wine. 
And yet the Devil cannot make it. 
And yet the summit cannot see: 
And yet, I think, dost not incline that way. 
And yet, beyond a cavil, 
And yet, by some one, in that nightly hour, 
And yet, from childhood up familiar with the note, 
          And yet, he coaxed her soon aside, 
And yet, she's older than fourteen. 
And yet, some hitch in't there must be 
And yet, somehow, his face I can't discover. 
And yet, the struggle fails; since Light, howe'er it weaves, 
And yet, there's nothing I've collected-- 
And yet, this once my thanks I owe 
And yet, this want may be supplied us; 
And you? 
And you look as though 
And you, Sir, travel always, do you not? 
And yours that still I have in hand? 
And, God! who can the field embrace? 
        And, ah! his kiss! 
And, as regards the foot, which I can't spare, in truth, 
And, filled with mystic presage, chimed the church-bell slowly, 
And, for the first time, here I stand 
And, freed from the fumes of lore that swathe me, 
And, haply, ere one travels half the course 
And, if it last, wilt soon be plighted 
And, if they've not bewitched my sense, 
And, if thou art satisfied, 
And, if we're light, we'll travel swift and clear: 
And, if you'll probe the thing profoundly, 
And, lacking blossoms, blue, yellow, and red, 
And, like a bankrupt debtor sitting, 
And, like an old and half-extinct tradition, 
And, once for all, I grudge thee not the pleasure 
And, strange! around her fairest throat 
And, truly! godless cannot be 
And, truly, I did naught to fret him: 
And, truly, it would easier be 
And, when it finds an angle-worm, rejoices! 
And, worst of all, full many a wight 
Another baffled hope must be lamented: 
Another bite makes free the door: 
Another, satiate, leaves the banquet's tapers, 
     Apples have been desired by you, 
     Arches above him! 
Arches not there the sky above us? 
Are anything but pleasant places. 
Are bright as in Creation's hour. 
Are bright as on the earliest day. 
Are good to fish and sport in: 
Are known to me, and hated, too. 
Are more than magic's empty show. 
Are not their forces also lent me? 
Are now a book with seven seals protected: 
Are now illuminated: 
Are over--'tis all in vain! 
     Are they all awake and crying? 
Are unrefreshing as the winds that blow 
Are we the sport of every changeful atmosphere? 
Are you, perhaps, a virtuoso? 
Ariel's song is heavenly-pure, 
Around me here, of spirit-presence fullest? 
Around my head!--There falls 
          Around the linden lass and lad 
Art thou a man, then pity my distress! 
Art thou, my gay one, 
Art with the Devil hand and glove, 
     As 'twere five hundred hogs, we feel 
As Dilettante I the curtain raise. 
As I the thousand blossoms broke, 
As Orpheus' lyre the brutes compelled, 
As best it pleases thee. 
As did a certain snake, my near relation. 
As did the Holy Ghost dictate to thee! 
     As doth the snail in shell, we crawl: 
As early to my clouded sight ye shone! 
As forwards, onwards, ever must endure; 
As from a corpse that breeds infection. 
As glittering gallants rated. 
            As goes the crowd, I follow. 
As haply now and then the case may be. 
As he does in his dull old mill, 
As he in Naples wandered round, unfriended; 
As here of Schwerdtlein's death and place of rest? 
     As his own son were he. 
As his repulsive face has done. 
As if a mill-wheel whirled in my head! 
As if but toadstools were the things, 
     As if he had love in his bosom! 
     As if he had love in his bosom. 
     As if he had love in his bosom! 
     As if he had love in his bosom! 
     As if he had love in his bosom. 
     "As if he had love in his bosom!" 
As if in Spanish boots 'twere laced, 
As if my kindly Margaret were she. 
As if stood before you, gray and loath, 
As if the Holy Host came by. 
As if with fettered feet that stay her going. 
As if you'd use, to get control, 
As in Italian tales 'tis taught. 
As in a love-adventure they might play! 
        As in the early morning 
As in the mouths of puppets are befitting! 
As is a devil in despair. 
As long as he on earth shall live, 
        As oft as he drank thereout. 
As the Cathedral thou wert quitting? 
As the first they must everywhere shine, 
(_As the_ WITCH _starts back, full of wrath and horror_) 
As they are seen by each and all. 
As thou, up yonder, with running and leaping 
As though my legs were four-and-twenty. 
As through the garden-gate I came? 
     As time, foul ass! 
As warmer life in every limb had crowned you; 
As was my first, this world will hardly give me. 
As well thou know'st, within an hour 'twill kill him. 
As when from melted snow a streamlet overflows; 
As when to spirits spirits speak. 
As wife and child, as knave and plow! 
_(Aside)_ 
Ask priest or sage the answer to declare, 
Ask you, pray? 
Assume the part of wizard or of devil? 
Assuredly. 
At Neighbor Martha's you'll this evening meet. 
At Padua rest, in consecrated soil. 
At every step one strikes a rock or tree! 
At first, reluctant, takes its food, 
At home I've neither rest nor cheer, 
        At last expire! 
At least, I hold it so much gain for me, 
At midnight is our compact broken. 
At night, one learns his house to prize:-- 
At night, our times of peace abiding. 
At once confide all others in you. 
At once to set about rewarding. 
     At once, whene'er they bite. 
     At once, whene'er they bite! 
At our last interview, before we parted 
At the first glance who sees it runs away. 
        At the pane I sit; 
At village and dance parading! 
Attention! Hearken now to me! 
Away! Follow the ridge 
Away, now! 
Away, thou pimp! 
                    Ay! we must away.

Beasts, birds, trees, rocks, and all such lumber, 
Beckons afar, the race awaiting; 
Beckons my neighbor with her wanton glances, 
Before all else, I bring thee hither 
Before folks, lest there be misgiving: 
Before him I should blush, ashamed. 
Before me, teaching me to know my brothers 
Before no king that could be named! 
Before the Mother of God we'll lay it; 
Before the Thunder's crashing way: 
Before the joys of life shall pall. 
        Before thy lover's door? 
     Before us go the women all. 
Before which they bow, 
Behind her chair, was listening nigh. 
     Behind me, field and meadow sleeping, 
Behind the house, in my garden, then, 
Behind the stove repose thee in quiet! 
Behind the stove still banned, 
Behold him stop--upon his belly crawl--His 
Behold my wares attentively: 
  Behold, how needful here your aid is, 
Believe me, who for many a thousand year 
Believest thou in God? 
Beside the good Saint Antony, 
Besides, he's gone. 
Besides, his penitence was very sore, 
Betake thee to Hell! 
Betake thyself to yonder field, 
Better the summit, I must own: 
Beware the lure within her lovely tresses, 
        Beware! the blade 
Beware, a tinkling fool to be! 
        Beyond expressing, 
     Bid the new career 
  Birth and the Grave, 
Black as it seemed, I blackened still, 
        Blessing, succeeding Him, 
Blest he, whose bosom Truth makes pure and fair! 
Bliss grows apace, and then its course is jangled; 
          Bliss hath invested him,-- 
     Bloated-bellied, through the bushes? 
Blood is a juice of rarest quality. 
     Blossoming forelands, 
Body and soul thereon I'll wreak; 
        Bold is the venture, 
        Bold is the venture, 
     Boldly the highlands, 
     Born of blue ether, 
Both clear and muddy streams, for me 
Both ease and grace will fail me there. 
Both flower and fruit the future years adorning? 
        Both shall be ours! 
Boughs are groaning and breaking, 
     Bower on bower! 
Brass, marble, parchment, paper, clay? 
Bravo! bravo! that was fine. 
     Break from the sky! 
        Break from your gloom! 
Breathing her atmosphere in fullest measure. 
Brides only, and the sweetest!

     Build it again, 
     Burn bone and brain! 
        Burst from the vaulted 
        Burst ye the prison, 
But 'tis not meant to thrust 
But I am sure--that you are very kind. 
But I must go. 
But I was angry with myself, to feel 
But I, alone, would shun these shallow matters, 
But Margaret thought, with sour grimace, 
But _Devil_ rhymes with _Doubt_ alone, 
But _the Golden_ give to me, 
But _us_ he thrusts in darkness, out of sight, 
But ah! I feel, though will thereto be stronger, 
But away! [_Exeunt_. 
But come! we'll go from this fire to a newer: 
But come, away! 'Tis time for us to fly; 
But come: the further talking brings 
But do church-penance in her sinner's shift! 
But do not give too very small a sample; 
But duskly through the painted panes. 
But evil tongues in this town have full play. 
But fifteen minutes' time is all I need; 
But first, at least this half a year, 
But follow now! 'Tis all I beg of thee. 
But for the gleam of heavenly light which Thou hast lent 
But get fresh jewels to her taste! 
But grantest, that in her profoundest breast 
But have a care that you nothing spill! 
But have a care, lest Folly be omitted! 
But here the penal court will sift and sound it. 
But hither bring us thy potation, 
But honored and at home is here the cloven foot. 
     But howsoe'er she hasten may, 
But if you forwards go, his ire is most displayed. 
But in another book 'tis writ for thee, 
But in some corner, woe betide thee! 
But is there one in all the land 
But knowledge worth having I fain would get me. 
But let her growth and strength display, 
But let me suckle, first, my baby! 
But let us not, by such despondence, so 
But might, the while, more useful be. 
But mind, allow the tailor no caprices: 
But more on him who gave her such delight. 
But mother's sleep so light has grown, 
But ne'er from heart to heart you'll speak inspiring, 
But never succeed in being weavers. 
But never yet such impulse felt, as this is. 
But no more, no more can I attain it! 
But none the more do others care. 
But not at the dances! 
But not the least bit shrewd or smart, 
But not too very far, I pray! 
     But nothing cured his raving. 
But now all things have from their bases slid, 
But now my days have less of noise and hurry; 
But now, leave jesting out of sight! 
But on a gala-day one may his orders show. 
But one thing more! Beyond all risk to bind thee, 
But only two wear powder. 
But only, on so bold a flight, 
But other aspects now obtain: 
But see! He's dead therefrom, at last. 
But see, what motley flames among the heather! 
But some wild dream is sent to fray me. 
But something new must then requite you. 
But soon to seek them is beguiled. 
But spying all the doings of one's neighbor: 
But still the time may reach us, good my friend. 
But stipulating, that I may 
But such a course thou wilt not long endure; 
But surely, also, many a weary hour. 
But tell me now, ye cursed puppets, 
But tell me, pray, the proper means to gain them. 
But that a dream the Devil counterfeited, 
But that familiar harp with soul 
But the spiritual link is lost, alas! 
But the sun will permit no white to sparkle; 
But then come on the evil days, 
But then one learns to relish rest and food. 
But then, alas! they've read an awful deal. 
But then, it's not a pleasant way. 
But then, reflect: the mountain's magic-mad to-day, 
But then, the world--the human heart and brain! 
But there enigmas also knotted be. 
But they'll accept us, after all, I'm sure. 
But think, the chances of the case! 
But this is not of swift conclusion; 
But thou hast heard, 'tis not of joy we're talking. 
But three drops of it measure, 
But time through order may be won, I promise. 
But what comes sneaking, there, to view? 
But what do I see in the creature? 
But what has happened, tell me now? 
But what is all your fun to me? 
But who is that? 
But win her by my own persuasion. 
But with the grapes how was it, pray? 
        But with the wedding-ring! 
But would that I, on mountains grand, 
But ye, God's sons in love and duty, 
But yet, a little poem. 
But you have friends in other places, 
But you in health came out again. 
But, I must beg you, of the oldest brewage; 
But, ah! in the streets I dare not bear them, 
But, if thou hadst the power of guessing, 
But, let us go! 'Tis gray and dusky all: 
But, much as my heart to see thee yearneth, 
But, see! in all their height, at present, 
By Heaven, the girl is wondrous fair! 
By Nature's listless hand the thread is twirled, 
By Three and One, and One and Three, 
By all love ever rejected! By hell-fire hot and unsparing! 
By all things saddened and oppressed; 
By bodies is its course impeded; 
By daylight even, they push and cram in 
By sheer diffuseness you have won their graces, 
By storm she cannot captured be; 
By such alone can we be won. 
     By the blow of a demigod shattered! 
By the chimney out! 
By the quickening glance of the gracious Spring; 
By turns in either bridal chamber housed.

Each bit of dung he seeks, to stick his nose in.

Each leaf for such a pact is good; 
Each on the other is dashing,

Each one's a fine musician! 
Each shares therein, though few may comprehend: 
Each tender soul, with sentimental power,

Every flea may it so befall! 
Everywhere form in development moveth; 
        Except the goblet of gold.

Fails to subdue the tumult of his breast. 
Fair greeting, gentlemen! 
Fair lady, let it not offend you, 
Fairy king and fairy queen, 
          Faithful and gracious, 
False calves these many years upon me. 
     False word and form of air, 
Falters, oppressed with unknown needs? 
Far away, or nearer singing? 
Farewell! 
Farewell! 
Fate such a bold, untrammelled spirit gave him, 
Father had died before it saw the light, 
Fear not that I this pact shall seek to sever? 
     Feel with polypus-antennae 
Feeling is all in all: 
     Fell on the hearth, and squirming lay, 
Fill up my glass with sweetest, will you? 
Filling the All with harmony unceasing! 
Finally she brings a great book, and stations in the circle 
Find'st nothing right on earth, eternally? 
Finding them often hard to measure: 
Fire, water, darkness, Day and Night! 
First Love returns, with Friendship in his train. 
First be separated! 
First came thy passion's flood and poured around her 
First children, and then work for bread to feed 'em,-- 
First drives out the soul with rigid persistence; 
First, the _collegium logicum_. 
First, to encounter the beast, 
Five hours a day, you understand, 
Fix and arrange it to my will; 
Fix in its place with thoughts that stand forever! 
     Flames in the breast each faded ember, 
Float in thy twilight the meadows over, 
     Flow foamingly together, 
     Flow into rivers 
                 Flown up the alley yonder, 
     Fly away! Fly away_! 
     Fly ever sunward 
Fly! Up, and seek the broad, free land! 
Fly-snout and mosquito-bill, 
Fly-snout and mosquito-bill,-- 
Folds and upholds he not 
Follow the ancient text, and the snake thou wast ordered to trample! 
Follow up my airy track 
        Followers, Him we miss; 
Follows his path of mystery. 
     Follows them over. 
For 'tis my pleasure-to behold them surging, 
For Devils and for spectres this is law: 
"For God's sake," others to assist. 
For Martha Schwerdtlein I'd inquire! 
For all of thy half-hellish brood 
For bread, in the widest sense, to drudge, 
For cool, eternal rest created. 
For each beholds what in his bosom lurks. 
For ends like these, the gracious Muses? 
For further visits thou hast leave. 
For good things, oft, are not so near; 
     For he, without measure, 
        For him alone; 
For in the rat by poison bloated 
For just where fails the comprehension, 
For love, my blood and life would I surrender, 
For me, I grant, sour wine is out of place; 
For my Italian journey. 
For now, thy vapors to dispel, 
For one whose mind the Word so much despises; 
For our fine trip, meanwhile, prepare thyself with speed! 
For since we two together met, 
For that serene and solemn Spirit-Land: 
     For the children of men, 
For the last time beheld my woe! 
     For the wanderer. Mice are flying, 
For thee be speech divine! He loves thee! 
        For thee these flowers I set. 
For there arises now a murderous cry. 
For this performance I your debtor prove.-- 
For this, all pleasure am I foregoing; 
For thou art right, especially since I 
For thou hast no Christianity. 
For thou hast torn me from that desperate state 
        For us be suing,-- 
For what goes in--or won't go in--your mind. 
For what one has, in black and white, 
For which I prayed. Not unto me in vain 
For wilt thou not, no lover fairer, 
For with the people, as with women, 
For you no bound, no term is set. 
For zigzag courses we are wont to keep. 
For, as regards this science, let me hint 
For, if its quality I decide, 
Foreboding angel that thou art! 
Forerunning the grand Walpurgis-Night: 
Forfeit so wantonly, to swell your treasure? 
Forgiveness in the richest measure. 
Forsooth! He serves you after strange devices: 
Forsooth, if I am all I see, 
Forsooth, the eyes they are of one whom, dying, 
_Fortissimo_. 
     Fragments into the Void we carry, 
     Freer and fairer. 
Friendly, the everlasting stars? 
     Fright us, weirdest links uncoiling 
Frightened, the owlets are scattered: 
Frog in grass and cricket-trill, 
Frog in grass, and cricket-trill,-- 
Frog in green, and cricket-trill. 
From Earth the highest raptures and the best, 
From Heaven they represent themselves to be, 
From Heaven through Earth I see them pressing, 
From Heaven, across the World, to Hell! 
From Nostradamus' very hand, 
From Water, Earth, and Air unfolding, 
     From all men deeply hidden! 
From an old hag shall I demand assistance? 
From ashy rest 
From earthquake, tempest, wave, volcano's brand, 
From end to end, with labor keen; 
From every precipice and thicket damp 
     From five and six 
From generation unto generation fitted, 
From happy hours, and left me to deplore them. 
From here to eternal rest: 
From magic airs that round your march awaken. 
From page to page, from book to book! 
From sea to land, from land to sea. 
From such a face as thine there is no telling. 
From the bonds of Work, from Trade's restriction; 
From the churches' solemn and reverend night, 
From the low, dark rooms, scarce habitable; 
From the marshes we appear, 
From the narrow, crushing streets and alleys; 
From the pressing weight of roof and gable; 
From thee, thou jade! and seek protection 
From these the angels draw their power, 
Full many a place of meeting. 
Full many a pleasant place I know, 
Full thirty years from my existence? 
Full well you know what here is wanting; 
Further and satisfy your pain,

     Garments, out-flowing, 
Gave us so much of helping care. 
     Gems, as it boundeth 
Gently upon _my_ road to train him! 
Get me a kerchief from her breast,-- 
Get me a little wax, to make the stoppers, quick! 
Get me something the angel keeps! 
Get thee away with thine offences, 
Get thou a set for her again! 
Give me a chair! I sink! my senses swim. 
Give me a line or two, I pray. 
Give me thy hand! 'Tis not a dream! 
Give the rein to his imagination, 
Give us a goblet of the well-known juice! 
Give us a song! 
Give, unrestrained, the old emotion, 
Gladly obey, because they gladly cheat us; 
          Gloriously ended! 
Gnash not thus thy devouring teeth at me? It fills me with horrible 
    Gnome, be laborious! 
Go a-foot no more we can, 
Go on! It is a woe profound! 
Go to the River Tavern, I should say. 
Go! go! I never will retreat. 
Go! you'll laugh at me. 
Go, find yourself a more obedient slave! 
Go, league thyself with a poet, 
God forgive my husband, yet he 
God help us! that is done with: 
God knows I loved, and can't forget him! 
God! was so good, so dear, so true! 
Good Heaven! My mother can that have been? 
                  Good Sir, pray do! 
Good Sir, you see the facts precisely 
  Good gentlemen and lovely ladies, 
Good! if I have the choice, so let the wine be Rhenish! 
Good! the method is revealed 
        Good-night to thee, poor thing! 
Gossip! the times thou badly comprehendest: 
Grant me this favor, I beseech you! 
     Grapes that o'ercluster 
     Grapes the vine-stem bears, 
Grasp me not so murderously! 
Grasp my skirt with heart undaunted! 
Grasp the exhaustless life that all men live! 
Grateful for gifts the Holy Christmas gave her, 
        Grave, and all-gloriously 
Great good, I hope, the thing will do thee. 
     Great lords at court became. 
Greet her? Not I: unless, when meeting, 
Gulps the wild Moment in its greedy breast;

HOW otherwise was it, Margaret, 
HUCKSTER-WITCH 
Ha! do I trap thee! 
Ha! ha! That's just your way, I know: 
     "Ha! ha! he's at his last gasp," said she, 
Ha! in my heart what rending stroke! 
Ha! know'st thou me? Abomination, thou! 
Ha! what a sudden rapture leaps from this 
Had I a certificate to show! 
Had I but seven hours for all, 
Had I not been, so hadst thou, sure, 
     Had a coat with ribbons streaming, 
Had he all love, all faith forgotten in his riot? 
Had he not made himself the Devil's, naught could save 
Had not enough, to thrust 
Had you not, long since, demonstration 
Hail him, who keeps a steadfast mind! 
Half God within thee! 
Half conscious of his frenzied, crazed unrest, 
Half sport of childhood, 
Half-rotten straw: and yet, he died a Christian, sure, 
Halt, there! Ho, there! 
Hang on your bosom and caress you; 
Hark! how the forests grind and crack! 
     Hark, the inspiring 
        Has He, victoriously, 
Has Nature, then, and has a noble mind 
Has for ill-gotten goods the right digestion." 
Has given my heart so keen a pang of loathing, 
Has not Sir Mammon grandly lighted 
Has not your heart been anywhere subjected? 
Has room, elsewhere, to ply his trade. 
Has still an instinct of the one true way. 
     Has wrought for our pleasure. 
Hasn't done his duty by me! 
Hast for the scarlet coat no reverence? 
Hast never known a man, nor proved his word's intent? 
Hast nothing heard of Barbara? 
                          Hast played the spy again? 
Hast thou done? 
Hast thou thy countenance revealed in fire. 
Hast thou, then, nothing more to mention? 
Hath eaten many a land as forfeit, 
Haughty and discontented they appear. 
Have I concealed this countenance?-- 
Have all one source, one mode of healing; 
Have evermore been crucified and burned. 
Have led thy life, bereft of me? 
Have lent, in need and tribulation. 
Have mercy on me, let me live! 
Have sung him truly into slumber: 
Have you not led this life quite long enough? 
Have you not terms and definitions given 
Have you, perchance, elsewhere begun? 
Have, from this desk, seen climb the sky 
(_He bows to_ FROSCH.) 
          He broke the ranks, no whit afraid, 
     He called his man of stitches; 
He calls it Reason--thence his power's increased, 
He cannot change external forces. 
He cannot choose but err. 
He comes! 
(_He contemplates the sign_.) 
He cried: "I find my conduct wholly hateful! 
(_He disappears with_ FAUST.) 
(_He disappears with_ FAUST: _the revellers start and separate_.) 
(_He disguises himself_.) 
        He drained it at every bout: 
He ends with step of thunder-sound. 
_(He enters_.) 
He gave you, further, no commission? 
     He gnawed and scratched the house throughout. 
(_He goes on with_ WAGNER.) 
(_He grasps both her hands_.) 
(_He grasps the lock: the sound of singing is heard inside_.) 
     He had a paunch beneath his vest 
     He had the first of stations, 
(_He invites_ MEPHISTOPHELES _to sit down_.) 
He is a friend of mine, with whom it will agree, 
He is a man of manifold degrees, 
He is the proper man. 
(_He kisses her hand_.) 
(_He kisses her_.) 
     He knows not the kettle! 
     He knows not the pot, 
He lays for us the pillows straight! 
He lied! What! On the brink of death he slandered? 
(_He lifts one of the bed-curtains_.) 
He looks around so sneeringly, 
He loves me! 
He loves me--loves me not. 
(_He makes an indecent gesture_.) 
He must not unconsoled depart. 
     He ne'er will fly, who now not flies. 
     He now was wholly drest-- 
He now will seat him in the nearest puddle; 
(_He opens a volume, and commences_.) 
(_He opens the Book, and perceives the sign of the Macrocosm_.) 
(_He persuades_ FAUST _to step into the circle_.) 
(_He places the casket in the press, and locks it again_.) 
     He ran around, he ran about, 
     He ran into the kitchen, 
He resembles a hippopotamus, 
He rises mightily: 
(_He runs to the_ SHE-APE, _and lets her look through it_.) 
He said: "I had no time for play, for gaping freedom: 
        He sat at the royal banquet 
        He saw it plunging and filling, 
He saw, at once, where the game was hidden, 
"He scents the Jesuits' traces." 
He seeks me! 
He seemed to have the sudden feeling 
                 He seems of her still fonder. 
(_He seizes the book, and mysteriously pronounces the sign of

He shall not leave the spot alive.

He sleeps! Enough, ye fays! your airy number 
He snares our feet, some future chain to bind. 
He snuffles all he snuffle can: 
He spake: "That is the proper view,-- 
He suits me not at all, our new-made Burgomaster!

He takes thee for a lady, dear! 
He takes these gaudy people instead.

(_He turns the leaves impatiently, and perceives the sign of the 
(_He turns towards the table_.) 
He walks with haughty paces: 
     He whirled and jumped, with torment mad, 
He who would study organic existence, 
He will brighten the world with the tints he loveth, 
(_He writes, and returns the book_.) 
He! he! suffer him not! 
He'd be a fool! A brisk young blade 
He'd show, at any rate, good-will,-- 
He'll be of spirits and of Spirit cured. 
He'll be with Curly-head, I heard him say. 
He'll surely take her for his wife. 
  He's only glad who gives away: 
He's surely not alone to-day: 
_He_ art thou, who, my presence breathing, seeing, 
_He_ dwells in splendor single and eternal, 
Health to the man, so skilled and tried. 
     Hear I noises? songs that follow? 
     Hear I tender love-petitions? 
Hear me exorcise thee! 
Hear me not falsely, sweetest countenance! 
Hear me relate the mournful tale! 
Hear one strong word that might explain you. 
Hear the _schnecke-schnicke-schnack_ 
     Hear them snoring, hear them blowing! 
Hear them, to deeds and passion 
Hear'st thou voices higher ringing? 
Hear, hear! A flea! D'ye rightly take the jest? 
Hear, of that girl I'd have possession! 
Hear, therefore, one alone, for that is best, in sooth, 
Hearken! the pillars are shattered. 
(_Heaven closes: the_ ARCHANGELS _separate_.) 
     Heaven's own children 
Hell heaves in thunder! 
Hell's fugitive stray-one? 
Help! Fire! Help! Hell-fire is sent! 
        Help! rescue me from death and stain! 
Help, Devil! through the coming pangs to push me; 
Hemmed in by many a toppling heap 
Henry! Henry! 
Henry! I shudder to think of thee. 
Her head beneath her arm she'll sometimes carry; 
Her life, in fact, they're loath to spare her. 
Her little world therein concealed. 
Her paramour should be an ugly gnome, 
Her simple, homely life commences, 
Her thoughts and yearnings seek thee, tenderer, fonder,-- 
Her time is miserably long; 
Here! 
Here I am Man,--dare man to be! 
Here Nature shaped, as if in sportive playing, 
Here a middle-peak is planted, 
Here am I balked: who, now can help afford? 
Here am I!--what mean perturbation 
     Here bright it gleams, 
     Here brighter seems: 
Here burns the glow through film and haze: 
Here could I spend whole hours, delaying: 
Here from our wandering will we rest contented. 
Here gush the sparkles incandescent 
Here high and low contented see! 
Here is a casket, not unmeet, 
Here is a phial: in her drink 
Here is a song, which, if you sometimes sing, 
Here is the People's proper Heaven; 
Here is the genuine path for you; 
Here lay the child, with Life's warm essence 
Here lies one dead already--see! 
Here lieth one who loves thee ever, 
Here meekly kissed the grandsire's withered hand. 
Here rustles one that soon will work my liberation. 
Here steam, there rolling vapor sweepeth; 
Here to the altar cam'st, 
Here will we house ourselves in quiet. 
Here winds away, and in a hundred 
Here words and prayers are nothing worth; 
Here, Doctor, hold to me: in one jump we'll resume 
Here, for the folk, each day's a holiday: 
Here, lost in thought, I've lingered oft alone, 
     Here, measure the lad for breeches. 
Here, on this earth, my pleasures have their sources; 
Here, over this green arbor bending, 
Here, rich in hope and firm in faith, 
Here, set it in the press, with haste! 
_Here_, an unwearied slave, I'll wear thy tether, 
Hide from my view the surging crowd that passes, 
Hide thyself! Sin and shame 
Himself a whole so frequently, 
            Himself with care arraying: 
        His eyes with tears ran over, 
        His lofty gait, 
        His noble size, 
His own most natural form he sees. 
His palace for this festal night? 
His partner in the dance you'll be,-- 
His path predestined through Creation 
His pink of girls right lustily, 
His prey to discover! 
His spirit's ferment far aspireth; 
     His thirst in puddles laving; 
His tones are sweet and rare ones: 
His way one gladly loses; 
                     Hither to me! 
Ho, there! my friend! I'll levy thine attendance: 
Hold fast, lest thou be hurled down the abysses there! 
Hold! hold! It will!--If such my flame, 
     Hoo-hoo! Shoo-hoo! Nearer hover 
     Horns the he-goat wears! 
How? 
How? 
How Cupid stirs and leaps, on light and restless wing. 
How all around a sense impresses 
How beautiful that woman-form! 
How can a further test delight you? 
How changed in fashion 
How comes it that thou dost not shrink from me?-- 
How comes that lovely casket here to me? 
How deeply am I moved, this hour! 
How do you mean? Have you so many kinds? 
How does it hold together_? 
How each his legs in nimble trip 
How each the Whole its substance gives, 
How fares the heart within your breast? 
How findest thou the tender creatures? 
How from the window of the sacristy 
How grand a show! but, ah! a show alone. 
How hard it is to compass the assistance 
How has he helped the town, I say? 
How ill it suits the Artist, proud and true! 
How is it, then? my hand's already lame: 
How is it? under way? and soon complete? 
How is't with thy religion, pray? 
How little now I deem, 
How lively, see! the multitude sallies, 
How long and broad my poodle grows! 
How lucky he, whose gifts his station 
          How many a one has fooled his dear, 
How many have I made away with! 
How men torment themselves, is all I've noted. 
How now! You're talking like Jack Rake, 
How oft the children, with their ruddy charms, 
How otherwise the mental raptures bear us 
How otherwise upon me works this sign! 
How raves the tempest through the air! 
How roars the orgy louder! 
How sadly rises, incomplete and ruddy, 
How scornfully I once reviled, 
How shall one lead it by persuasion? 
How shall we leave the house, and start? 
How shall we plan, that all be fresh and new,-- 
How she cast down her timid eyes, 
How she stared and glared! 
How short and sharp of speech was she, 
How small the giant lout would be, 
  How so? 
How so? 
                        How so? 
     How soon will't spring, 
How strangely glimmers through the hollows 
How the dull fools enjoy the matter! 
How this pure soul, of faith so lowly, 
How would I for the fault atonement render! 
How would the ape be sure his luck enhances. 
How would the pearl-chain suit my hair? 
How, in crowds together massed, 
Howe'er for them one may have worked and planned? 
Hung here, around this throne, where sat the father!

I am a creature young and poor: 
I am free! No one shall enthrall me. 
I am no hair's-breadth more in height, 
I am not one of the greatest, 
I am not used to that; I cannot stoop to try it-- 
I am seized, and bound, and delivered-- 
I am so happy on thine arm, 
I am the Spirit that Denies! 
I am the fugitive, all houseless roaming, 
I am the go-between, and thou the wooer. 
I beg you, ladies, to excuse me. 
"I believe in God!" to say? 
I blissed it all this livelong night; 
I bring the unknown multitude my treasures; 
I brought it up, and it was fond of me. 
I burn! I burn! 
I call a flea a tidy guest. 
I came, with lust of instant pleasure, 
I can't think what he finds in me! [_Exit_. 
I cannot breathe! 
I cannot call them liars, either. 
I cannot here disguise me, if I try. 
I cannot loosen the bonds of the Avenger, nor undo his bolts. Rescue 
I cannot really go away: 
I cannot reconcile myself to Jurisprudence. 
I cannot understand you quite. 
I claim, I tell thee, all my right; 
I come, a squire of high degree, 
I crave the highest erudition; 
I craved, to censure others' vices. 
I dare not go: there's no hope any more. 
I do not pretend I could be a teacher 
I do not pretend to aught worth knowing, 
I dread to see how such a fate advances. 
I dread, once again to see her? 
I envy even the Body of the Lord 
I fain would drink with you, my glass to Freedom clinking, 
I feel a youthful, holy, vital bliss 
I feel an icy shiver! 
I feel as if the organ here 
I feel as stupid, from all you've said, 
I feel as though I'd lost my love for thee. 
I feel his presence like something ill. 
I feel impelled, its meaning to determine,-- 
I feel in every limb the presage 
I feel so small before others, and thence 
I feel that I am far behind, indeed. 
I feel that men are ripe for Judgment-Day, 
I feel thee draw my heart, absorb, exhaust me: 
I feel thy presence, Spirit I invoke! 
I feel, I know not why, such fear!-- 
I feel, O maid! thy very soul 
I feel, indeed, that I have made the treasure 
I feel, the gentleman allows for me, 
I felt a world arise for me. 
I find a box, the first resembling, 
I find it good: for that's your proper place. 
I find these walls, these vaulted spaces 
I freely leave the choice to thee. 
I gaze, as in the bosom of a friend. 
I give to spirit-despotism no place; 
I glow, as drunk with new-made wine: 
I go to God as a soldier brave. 
I gratulate thee on thy new career! 
I hasten on, his beams eternal drinking, 
I hate,--these noises of the throng: 
I have a friend of high condition, 
I have a mind to open it. 
I have myself inflated all too high; 
I have no name to give it! 
I have no power o'er souls so green. 
I have not snares around thee cast; 
I have thee! 
I hear one's footsteps, hither steering. 
I hear the distant drumming. 
I hear the noise of instruments attuning,-- 
I hear the noise of the village, even; 
I hold the sceptre, here,--and lack the crown alone. 
I honor them. 
I hope to see you moulder. 
I hope we'll suit each other well; 
I hope, ere, as the bodies die, it dies! 
I kept the baby's cradle near 
I knew the sweet sound of the voice of the vision! 
I know how one the People's taste may flatter, 
I know not what compels me to thy will: 
I know not what they are brewing and doing. 
I know not, should I do it? 
I know too well that my poor gossip can 
I know what science this has come to be. 
I lately gave therein a squint-- 
     I leave in deep, prophetic night, 
I like, at times, to hear The Ancient's word, 
     I live at present! 
I locked the press, most certainly. 
I mean, have you not felt desire, though ne'er so slightly? 
I meant to say, were you not touched in earnest, ever? 
I much prefer the cheeks where ruddy blood is leaping, 
I must be idiotic! 
I must confess that forth I may not wander, 
I must confess, it seems to me 
I must, perforce, look up the matter. _[Exit_. 
I need, at least, a fortnight's space, 
I never chanced, in all my days, to meet thee! 
I never could learn the ways of life. 
        I never shall find it, 
        I never shall find it, 
        I never shall find it, 
I nothing had, and yet enough for youth-- 
I notice no such thing, I vow! 
I now am conscious. With this ecstasy, 
     I offer here my best salute 
I offer it, and humbly wish 
I only seize, with sketchy air, 
I peeped at the owl in her nest alone: 
I praise the old ones, not unduly: 
I pray you, Friend, 'tis now the dead of night; 
I rub my hands, in expectation tender-- 
I sat in unconcerned repose, 
        I sat, in utter sorrow, 
I saw him with these eyes upon a wine-cask riding 
I saw, among the rest, a thing 
I say to thee, a speculative wight 
I scarce can stand, my knees are trembling! 
I see him timidly, in doubt, around us running, 
I see one yonder, burning merrily. 
I see stark-nude young witches congregate, 
I see the plan thou art pursuing: 
I see you have your fun at our expense. 
I seek him everywhere, I pry and peer, 
I seek, and cannot find, a name; 
I shall recover, dost thou tell me, 
I should not on the Devil call, 
I should not wish to see you here misguided: 
I soon shall lead him to a clearer morning. 
I speed along, completest man of all, 
I stand ashamed and in amaze, 
I stand, no wiser than before: 
  I stood beside his bed of dying. 
I swear to you, 'tis like a dream to me. 
I swear, 'twill turn her head, to spy it: 
I swear, with this condition, too, 
I take the cup you kindly reach, 
I take the wildering whirl, enjoyment's keenest pain, 
I tell thee, from thy tears refrain! 
I tell you, give but more--more, ever more, they ask: 
I tell you, once for all, that speed 
I tell you, spirits, to your face, 
     I then beheld an apple-tree, 
I think the Devil must fight! 
I think we'd better send him packing quietly. 
I think, how useful 'tis to write; 
I thrill and tremble; tear on tear is burning, 
I too, at last, shall with them all be stranded! 
I use no lengthened invocation: 
I venture not to soar to yonder regions 
I verily see a theatre. 
I view, through all my senses swiftly flowing! 
I want his death in the weekly paper stated. 
I was confused, the like ne'er happened me; 
I will confess, I knew not what appeal 
I will convey thee there; and hear, what I can do! Have I all the power 
I wish I knew something worse, that I might use it for 
I wish the crowd to feel itself well treated, 
I won't go there, your jolly rows disgust me! 
I would I had a more cheerful strain! 
I would force myself on thee and constrain it, 
I would have shared your watches with delight, 
I would myself unto the Devil deliver, 
I would not for the costliest stores of treasure-- 
I would, myself, change rings with you. 
I'd ask you, longer here to tarry, 
I'd build a thousand bridges meanwhile, I've a notion. 
I'd draw the bolts to-night, for thy desire; 
     I'd know him and shame him. 
I'd like to have a legal witness, 
I'd like to leave it, I must avow; 
I'd like, myself, such a one to see: 
I'd mourn him decently a year, 
I'd praise you if I found you snugly in the centre, 
I'd something give, could I but say 
I'd treat these worthy guests, with pleasure, 
I'll bring him here. 
I'll clasp thee, soon, with warmth a thousand-fold; 
I'll cut away, betimes, from here: 
I'll find her room to-day, and take you in it. 
I'll go ahead and introduce thee there, 
I'll hang thereon with joy, and freely drain them; 
I'll hear no more: 'tis vain to ponder 
I'll no longer suffer near me. 
I'll not be led by any lure 
I'll not forget while the world rolls on! 
I'll play the comedy with art. 
I'll sing her, first, a moral song, 
I'll stay with thee. 
I'll teach you how to grin, I'm thinking. 
I'll venture, then, to bear thee forth. 
I'll wait my proper time for laughter: 
I'll worm their secret out, I'm thinking. 
I'll yet detect thy sweetheart and ensnare her, 
I'm Magister--yea, Doctor--hight, 
I'm all a-tremble! 
I'm but a silly, fearsome thing! 
I'm cleverer, true, than those fops of teachers, 
I'm climbing now three hundred years, 
I'm dying! That is quickly said, 
I'm like a sentimental tom-cat, rather, 
I'm mostly used, 'tis true, to go incognito, 
I'm neither lady, neither fair, 
I'm she: what does the gentleman desire? 
I'm sorry I'm so blind: 
I'm tired enough of this dry tone,-- 
        I'm weeping, weeping, weeping, 
I've almost for Theology decided. 
I've done, else, all things for the love of thee. 
I've drowned the baby born to thee. 
I've else, for all, a kindly will, 
I've everywhere, in fact, been entertained politely. 
I've had, myself, at times, some odd caprices, 
I've heard, most fully, how she drew thee. 
I've led my scholars by the nose,-- 
                  I've long been grieved to see 
I've often heard it said, a preacher 
I've scarce the heart to plague the wretched creature. 
I've studied now Philosophy 
I, for a time, at least, have worked thy cure; 
I, image of the Godhead! 
I, image of the Godhead, who began-- 
I, too, was fair, and that was my undoing.

Idly to us they come, as to a masquerade, 
If 'twere a better wine that here I see you drinking. 
If 'twould, my love, would I advise it? 
If I am right, we heard the sound 
If I attempt to venture near, 
If I do him wrong, may God forgive! 
If I fulfill my expectation, 
If I mistake not, there are two. 
If I must share my chamber with thee, 
If I such things but half can judge. 
If I were not a Devil myself! 
If I've six stallions in my stall, 
If Man, that microcosmic fool, can see 
If Poetry be your vocation, 
If Thou hadst not all merriment unlearned. 
If _I_ should choose to preach Posterity, 
If _he's_ one, let me at him drive! 
If by the Spirit I am truly taught. 
If from the Desert sendeth them the South, 
If he can't every step bechatter, 
If he had only been as clever, 
If her whims the wife control, 
If him she gets, why let her beware! 
     If him------------------does not scare. 
If longer here thou stayest, 
If loving Nature at your back, 
     If lucky our hits, 
If not a husband, then a beau for you! 
If one comes bored, exhausted quite, 
If one is prim and good, as ancient rules compel: 
If one some index could be shown, 
If sacred or profane it be; 
If something's lost, he'll quickly bring it,-- 
If still they live, wide through the world are scattered. 
If such your taste, and be content; 
If that prevents, how cam'st thou in to me? 
If the diversion pleasant be. 
  If the grave is there, 
If the mountain we had only passed! 
If then appeared, with colors splendid, 
If there be airy spirits near, 
If there he's led, they think, he'll follow them as well. 
If there we cherish love or hate, 
If thine, or whose? 'tis needless to debate it. 
If thou feel'st it is I, then come with me! 
If thou therewith art fully satisfied, 
If tightly laced her corsets be. 
If unto me full leave you give, 
If what one does, or leaves undone, is right, 
If you but in yourself confide, 
If you desire, a number. 
If you would whirl in regular gyration 
If you've a piece, why, just in pieces give it: 
If you've naught better, then, I'll tear your pretty plan! 
     If your aid avail him, 
If your pairs would loving be,

Impertinent beast! 
Important matter, yet attractive too? 
Impotent showers of sleet that darkle 
Imprison me! 
        In Beauty's array, 
In Hell itself, then, laws are reckoned? 
In Nature and in Science too. 
In Padua buried, he is lying 
(_In a niche of the wall a shrine, with an image of the Mater 
In air and water and the silent wood. 
In all its tides sweeps not the world away, 
In all my life there's nothing 
In all the fullness of my vision 
     In beauty bewildering, 
In belts across the green o' the plain. 
In brooding souls the sunset burn above? 
In clasping maiden-arms he findeth! 
In compliments you're both proficient, 
        In daybreak clear, 
In dry, and wet, and warm, and chilly; 
In every quarter is preparing. 
In every vein and fibre newly glowing. 
In exercising, with the strictest care, 
In frightfully intricate crashing 
     In happy embraces, 
In head and breast there's something wrong. 
"In her the flower o' the sex is found!" 
In misery! In despair! Long wretchedly astray on the face of the earth, 
In motley pictures little light, 
In names like Beelzebub, Destroyer, Father of Lies. 
In night and dew to lie upon the mountains; 
In one foot is the fellow lame? 
In opening buds a marvel woke, 
In place of cheering drink, which one seeks vainly here, 
          In ribbons, wreath, and gayest vest 
     In ruin 'tis hurled, 
In scarlet coat, with golden trimming, 
     In silk and velvet gleaming 
In smaller circles one is not alone. 
In smoke and mould the fleshless dead 
In star and fire light shooting, 
In such an art I crave some preparation, 
In sullen jangle are together hurled,

"In the Beginning was the _Power,"_ I read.

        In the clasp of his hand, 
     In the damp moss and clay:_ 
     In the last convulsion twitching. 
In the last throes his senses wandered, 
        In the lofty hall of his fathers 
(_In the meantime the young apes have been playing with a 
In the pool! 
In the rush and roll of Circumstance! 
     In the sphere of dreams enchanted. 
  In the tides of Life, in Action's storm, 
     In the vast, the desert spaces! 
In these pure features I behold 
     In thine own bosom build it anew! 
In this game let our Lord God be! 
In this sense, even, canst thou venture. 
In thousand tones, 
In truth, 'tis well and fitly timed, 
     In two! in two! 
In vain that through the realms of science you may drift; 
In very terror I at morn awake, 
In yielding, that must be eternal! 
In young, wild years it suits your ways,

        Incline Thy countenance upon my pain!

Inspect the thing: the drawing's not completed.

     Into the depths of Nature peer,-- 
Into the high ancestral spaces. 
        Into the tide below.

Into the world of strife, 
Invisible, visible, round thy life? 
Invoke not thus the well-known throng, 
Irregular ways I've always hated; 
        Is He, in glow of birth, 
Is always for the wise, no less than fools, a mystery. 
Is by the wisest tolerated. 
Is dead? Alas, that heart so true! 
     Is evermore a ruined wight. 
Is for the wench a deal too good. 
Is forward, on the ledge, engraven. 
Is fresh from reading of the daily papers. 
Is in the beast: I see but drill, alone. 
Is it permitted that we share your leisure? 
Is it the _Thought_ which works, creates, indeed? 
Is it the first time in your life you're driven 
Is just the sum of my endeavor. 
Is like a beast on moorlands lean, 
Is made but for a God's delight! 
Is no one laughing? no one drinking? 
Is nothing but the spirit of you all, 
Is oft mere vanity and narrowness. 
Is open left--the lines don't fit it. 
Is parchment, then, the holy fount before thee, 
        Is racked and crazed; 
Is rare and strange, howe'er you take it: 
Is really too despotic: 
Is so exact! 
Is something worth, to every one. 
Is such delight, my steps would fain delay. 
Is that a devilish lying game? 
Is that in the course of nature? 
Is that which has the most attractive features! 
Is there a magic vapor here? 
Is't actual fact? or Fancy's shows? 
Is't but masquerading play? 
Is't life, I ask, is't even prudence, 
Is't not enough, that what I speak to-day 
Is't not his heart's accord, urged outward far and dim, 
Is't not soon enough when morning chime has run? 
Is't not sufficient company? 
     Is't the salamander pushes, 
Is't thence less wholly mine? 
Is, I perceive, a principle with you. 
     Islands, that flatter, 
It but depends upon the like of you, 
It dwarfed and withered all my soul's pretences! 
It fills the space entire, 
It flows from bodies, bodies beautifies; 
It gives me great vexation; 
It goes with me, as with the cat the mouse. 
It is a magic shape, a lifeless eidolon. 
It is an old, transmitted trade, 
It is enough that you are she: 
It is so close, so sultry, here! 
It is so ugly, rough to see! 
It is so wretched, forced to beg my living, 
It is so wretched, to be strange, forsaken, 
It is the greatest heavenly blessing, 
It makes me furious, such things beholding: 
It may be that your eyes deceive you slightly; 
It much becomes thee to be raving madly. 
It overcomes me in such degree, 
It seems the business has succeeded. 
It seems the mistress has gone away? 
It seems to me as if I hear 
It seems to me that with enchanted cunning 
It smiled, and tumbled, and grew strong. 
It stabbed me to the very heart. 
                                 It stinks! 
It thinks the end must soon occur. 
It was a blow that went through every limb! 
It will not harm her, when one tries it? 
It yonder hastes, new fields of life exploring; 
It's as if nobody had nothing to fetch and carry, 
It's long been written in the Book of Fable; 
It's really kind of such a noble Lord 
It's really shameful, I declare;-- 
It's too much, even for the like of me. 
It's true, Sibylla said, to-day. 
Its exhalation tracks and follows 
Its germs, productive powers explore, 
Its perfect stature stands at last confessed! 
Itself detaches, spreads and fades. 
     Jay and screech-owl, and the plover,-- 
Joy follows woe, woe after joy comes flying. 
Joy in Illusion, ardent thirst for Truth. 
        _Judex ergo cum sedebit, 
Judgment of God! myself to thee I give. 
Jump into hell instanter! 
Just as God will! 
Just as we meant to hold them fast together. 
Just see those handsome fellows, there! 
Just think, the pocket of a priest should get 
Just treat, and let the landlord me arraign! 
Just wait awhile: I'll have him yet. 
Just wait! a shower of blows is ready. 
        Kathrina dear, 
Keen scent has she for tainted air; 
Keep close! or we are parted, in our turn, 
     Keep thou away! 
Kindly content with any diet. 
Kiss me! 
Kiss me!--canst no longer do it? 
Knew you so much--and you'll confess it roundly!-- 
Know'st Faust? 
     Know'st thou the thief, 
Know'st thou, at last, thy Lord and Master? 
        Knowest Thou, and Thou alone! 
     Knowest and fearest thou

Ladies with him delighted are. 
 Ladies, farewell! 
        Lads, let the trumpets 
     Laid my bones in the wood, 
     Landscape and bower, 
Lay thyself at the feet of the Master! 
Lead me thither where she sleeps! 
Leaps, maddened, into the abyss's breast! 
Learn how we were mated! 
Learn of the great and little world your fill, 
Leave me alone, I beg of thee! 
Leave that, my child! Thou know'st my love is tender; 
Leave to the multitude their riot! 
Leave to withdraw from my intrusion. 
Left me lie in the straw where I lay. 
Lest my impatient pen proceed too fleetly. 
Let Fancy be with her attendants fitted,-- 
Let Neighbor Paunch to that attend! 
Let Poetry your will obey! 
Let but the Lying Spirit bind thee 
Let every marvel take form and fashion 
Let fall on me her fate, and also crush me,-- 
Let happen all that can or will! 
     Let him a-----------prepare, 
Let him find for thee the secret tether 
     Let it not fail him; 
Let me alone! I'll set them first to drinking, 
Let me not lose myself in all this pother! 
Let me not vainly entreat thee! 
  Let me not vainly sing my ditty; 
     Let me win in good season! 
Let not a word of moral law be spoken! 
Let not the chance neglected be! 
Let that day be the last for me! 
Let the thing be! All thence have evil drawn: 
Let them drop down the golden atmosphere, 
Let this warm clasp of hands declare thee 
Let us the sensual deeps explore, 
Let us, then, such a drama give! 
Let us, then, use a Jack-o'-lantern's glances: 
Let us, with speed, away from here! 
        Lets in a maid. 
Lies not beneath us, firm, the earth? 
Life be at last revealed to thee! 
Life somewhat better might content him, 
Life tracks his devious, labyrinthine chain, 
  Life, all-glowing, 
     Life-ward all hieing,-- 
Lifts up, and makes a clearance! 
     Light on the water! 
Like "the Gods of Greece," must he 
Like Germany's Parnassus. 
Like an eternal sickness of the race,-- 
Like eating and drinking, free and strong,-- 
Like elephant-calves about one! 
     Like glass doth ring, 
Like gossiping of war, and war's array, 
Like heavenly forces rising and descending, 
Like kittens playing with their tails? 
Like scattered showers of golden sand;-- 
Like sister Margaret, good as gold,-- 
     Like that of Doctor Luther. 
     Like the fox in a snare, 
          Linen to bind him 
Listen, my friend: the ages that are past 
     Little sister, so good, 
Little step and lofty leap 
Live with the like of him, may I never! 
Live with the ox as ox, and think it not a theft 
     Living knots and gnarls uncanny 
     Lo! in a shower 
Long from my sphere thy food exacted, 
Long is the calm brain active in creation; 
Long since: yet deemed him not important in the least. 
     Longing unending 
Look I not, eye to eye, on thee, 
Look out, I'll smoke them now! 
     Look through the sieve! 
Look yonder! thou canst scarcely see the end: 
Loose, Error, from their eyes the band, 
     Lost in illusion. 
        Love's time is brief: 
     Loveliest weather, 
     Lovers are plighted, 
Loves me--not--loves me--not-- 
        Lovingly needing him, 
Lulled in my lap with many a song, 
Lurks in the creature.

MERRY ANDREW 
MERRY-ANDREW 
MERRY-ANDREW 
MICHAEL 
MINISTER 
MUSAGETES 
Madam, it is a grief to me; 
Made with you gentlemen--and binding,--surely? 
Made, from his recipes unending, 
        Maidens and castles 
        Maidens disdainful 
     Make even three, 
     Make me rich in a trice, 
Make merry when the dance is going! 
Make room! Squire Voland comes! Room, gentle rabble, 
     Make seven and eight, 
     Make ten of one, 
Mammon in the mountain blaze. 
     Man in one leap has cleared the way. 
Man usually believes, if only words he hears, 
Man's active nature, flagging, seeks too soon the level; 
Man's misery even to pity moves my nature; 
Mankind's collected woe o'erwhelms me, here. 
Many enigmas there might find solution. 
Many the corpses carried forth, 
        Marching away! 
Margaret! 
Margaret! Margaret! 
Margaret! what's happened thee? 
Mark how, beneath the evening sunlight's glow, 
  Mark this, I beg of thee! 
        Master, Thy bliss! 
            May I not, then, upon you wait? 
May honor as is fitting. 
May it agree with you, what you get! 
Me by the nose she led, and now she'll lead you after. 
Me hast thou long with might attracted, 
Meanwhile, may not the treasure risen be, 
Medusa's tale to thee is known. 
Meets, to-night, my vision! 
Mephisto, seest thou there, 
Mere curiosity their spirits warming: 
Metaphysics learn the use and beauty! 
Methinks, instead of in the forests lording, 
'Mid brother-spheres, his ancient round: 
Midst of Hell's howling and noises appalling, 
Midst of the wrathful, infernal derision, 
Might I again presume, with trust unbounded, 
Might I, perhaps, depart at present? 
Might have the most genteel society to-day! 
Might learn, with a comedian for a teacher. 
     Mightier 
Miserable Faust! I know thee now no more. 
Misfortune tames him by degrees; 
Mist-like melting, ever faster. 
Mists rise,--red, angry rays are darting 
Misty vale and mountain gray, 
More in this hour to soothe thy senses, 
More speech than any tongue suffices 
Most Worthy Pedagogue, take heed! 
Most willingly, to what extent I may. 
Most wise! And first, of course, we'll make the journey 
Most zealously I seek for erudition: 
Mother is much too close with me. 
Much do I know--but to know all is my ambition. 
Much error, and of truth a glimmering mite, 
Much of his cousins did he speak, entreating 
Much the same way the preacher spoke, 
(_Murmurs, inspecting_ MEPHISTOPHELES _from the side_.) 
Must fifty years be rounded: 
Must leave, I fear me. 
Must play the Devil again, and fully. 
Must something clever be created. 
Must something fresh for their advantage give. 
Must start the needful perspiration, 
Must tell my name, old face of leather? 
Must the poor devil quit existence. 
Must use the tools that best are fitting. 
Must we? 
My Margaret, see! still young thou art, 
My bad luck brings me here, alas! 
My bed at night: if 't even stirred, I'd guess it, 
My body's chill and shuddering,-- 
My bosom burns with that sweet vision; 
My bosom thrills, with youthful passion shaken, 
        My bosom yearns 
My bosom, of its thirst for knowledge sated, 
My breath takes from me, 
My brother is a soldier, 
My brother! God! such words to me? 
My brother! This is Hell's own pain! 
"My child," she said, "ill-gotten good 
My darling, who shall dare 
My fairest luck finds no fruition: 
My father's was a sombre, brooding brain, 
     My father, the varlet, 
My final ruin then declare! 
My friend, so short a time thou'rt missing, 
My friend, take proper heed, I pray! 
My friend, thou soon shalt lose all such misgiving: 
My friend, thou'lt win, past all pretences, 
My future sweetheart, just as he were living. 
My hands are empty, otherwise. 
My head is nigh to split, I fear: 
        My heart is sore: 
        My heart is sore: 
        My heart is sore: 
My horses are neighing: 
My husband dead! Let me die, too! 
My little sister's dead. 
My love was near, but now he's far; 
My mind its fairest work to finish! 
My mother have I put to death; 
My mother was hardly willing to let me; 
My mother would--farewell! 
     _My mother, the harlot, 
My neighbor's one of them, I find, 
My own disgust is strengthened by your speech: 
My own head, now, is really nigh to sinking. 
My pathos certainly would move Thy laughter, 
        My peace is gone, 
        My peace is gone, 
        My peace is gone, 
        My poor weak head 
My powers I have not rashly estimated: 
My prayers for wife and little ones were zealous, 
My proper place is thy estate: 
My reverence, I hope, will me enable 
My senses heave in this convulsion! 
        My senses mazed. 
My servant, he! 
My softest cushion I give to thee. 
My song, to faint Aeolian murmurs turning, 
My spirit cannot practise it at all. 
My steps by one slight obstacle controlled,-- 
My sweetheart greet and kiss! I dare you to prevent it! 
My tears gush forth: the Earth takes back her child! 
My thanks! I find the dead no acquisition, 
        My thought is lost, 
My thoughts from torment, led me on, 
My troubled heart to joy unsealing, 
My very heart 
My views, when next I venture in. 
My voice to hear, my countenance to see; 
My wedding-day it was to be! 
My well-apportioned share of it." 
My wits, be certain, will befriend me. 
My work and worry, day and night? 
My worthy friend, gray are all theories, 
NIGHT 
NIGHT 
NIGHT 
NORTHERN ARTIST 
     Named inexpressibly, 
Nathless a parchment, writ and stamped with care, 
Naught but a plain black poodle do I see. 
        Naught else to his heir denying 
Naught so insipid in the world I find 
        Naught was to him more precious; 
Naught will succeed, I see, amid such revels; 
Nay, but I will! 
Nay, fear him not, my sweetest one! 
Nay, sheathe thy sword at last! 
Ne'er entertain such an experienced man. 
Needless your machinery: 
Neighbor! your cordial! (_She falls in a swoon_.) 
Neither scruples nor doubts come now to smite me, 
New strength and heart to meet the world incite me, 
        Nil inultum remanebit_. 
No! 
No beastliness and no stupidity. 
No broader than a knife-blade seeming! 
No crash of shipwreck shall have power to fright me! 
No cup, that hath not once, within a healthy frame 
No dagger's here, that set not blood to flowing; 
No dog would endure such a curst existence! 
No doubt 'twas late when you from Rippach started? 
No doubt you're much alone? 
No doubt you're right: no trace of mind, I own, 
No earthly meat or drink the fool suffices: 
No fount of newer strength is in my brain: 
No further step--no, no! 
No gems, that have not brought a maid to shame; 
No hand with loving pressure closed; 
No longer guest-right I bestow; 
No man the ancient leaven has digested! 
No mastery he inherits 
No need to tell me twice to do it! 
No one could ever speak to my discredit. 
No rest to-night for young or old! 
No sacrifice shall he repent of ever. 
No shop, on earth, like this you'll find!-- 
No skinflint bargain shalt thou see. 
No sword, but severed ties for the unwary, 
No test or trial you evaded: 
No true refreshment can restore thee, 
No word can ever lose a jot from thieving. 
No, Brother! not for me their formal ways. 
No, Lord! I find things, there, still bad as they can be. 
No, greet my sweetheart not! I tell you, I'll resent it. 
No, it is just in play. 
No, lead me where some heavenly silence glasses 
No, no! The paragon of all, believe me, 
No, no! Thou must outlive us. 
No, no,--no ending! no ending! 
No, not a word. I go so little out. 
No,--no! I'll turn and go to town again. 
No--let me go! I'll suffer no force! 
No--look me, Sirs, straight in the face! 
No--no! The Devil is an egotist, 
Nobody else will lie beside me!-- 
None ever found a thing to praise. 
Nor Hell nor Devil can longer affright me. 
Nor at the altar take thy place! 
Nor can I therefore greatly blame you students: 
Nor care for the appearance. 
Nor honors, save for him in store; 
Nor in the church be seen to wear them. 
Nor knows how herself she banters and blames! 
Nor nearer, to the Infinite, 
Nor other labor, 
Nor the desire for her sweet body bring 
Nor the world's least pomp or honor hold-- 
Nor would I beg the bird his wing to spare us: 
Not Art and Science serve, alone; 
Not a claw, no tail I see! 
Not any potent balsam yet invented? 
Not been by me disturbed or shaken: 
Not even a jewel, not a ring, 
Not even like thee! 
Not every girl keeps things so neat. 
Not for a monarch's robe--the gift resign. 
Not if he had them by the neck, I vow, 
Not me! 
Not only cold, amazed acquaintance yield'st, 
Not quite so fast! Two others come behind,-- 
Not so: the memory of it touched him quite. 
Not soon a second time he'll catch a prey so precious. 
Not soon again she frees him from her jesses. 
Not that she needs so much to keep expenses down: 
Not thee! 
Not yet art thou the man, to catch the Fiend and hold him!-- 
Not yet, it seems, have I given him pain. 
Note her especially, 
Now I'll tell thee the graves to give us: 
Now again requickened, 
Now am I wholly in thy might. 
Now draw the stoppers, and drink your fill! 
Now failing, now, perchance, success revealing,-- 
Now for the last time I've the witches'-hill ascended: 
Now is the lubber tame! 
Now like a fountain leaps and plays. 
Now like a tender thread it creepeth, 
Now like contempt the crowd's applauses seem: 
Now over each neck has quivered 
Now quick, away! 
Now she is lively, mostly sad, 
        Now sits exalted? 
Now that thou art a whore indeed, 
Now that's your fault; from you we nothing see, 
Now through the slumber of the grave 
Now we are already again at the end of our wits, where the understanding 
Now where, just tell me, is there better sport? 
          Now, don't be so familiar here! 
Now, give me of your taste some intimation. 
Now, in the Devil's name, go straight, 
Now, there you are! O holy man! 
Now, to undisguise thee, 
Now, wept beyond her tears; 
Now, what shall come of this? the creatures antic, 
Now, while the sky leads forth its starry throng, 
Now, whither shall we go? 
          "Now, you I call a stupid-head!" 
O Death!--I know it--'tis my Famulus! 
O God! 
        O Maiden! 
O Sibyl excellent, enough of adjuration! 
     O be thou so good 
O beautiful fountain, that flows at will! 
     O cast thou the dice! 
O dearest hand, to thee 'tis given 
O fortunate, for whom, when victory glances, 
O full and splendid Moon, whom I 
O had I ne'er been born! 
O happy he, who still renews 
O lend me, Love, the swiftest of thy pinions, 
O let us kneel, and call the Saints to hide us! 
O lucky he, whom you shall teach! 
O no! my wish is great, my power is only so-so. 
O no! with gentlemen of such pretence, 
O pardon, Sir, the rough salute! 
     O that the darkling 
O tremble not! but let this look, 
O welcome, twilight soft and sweet, 
O would that I, before that spirit-power, 
O yes, the gentleman finds it all child's-play! 
O yes, up to the stars at last! 
O'er books and papers saw me bend; 
O'er the Ilsen-stone. 
O'er the old city-wall, and far away. 
     O'er the stones, the grasses, flowing 
O, everywhere on him you fall! 
O, give me back my youth again! 
O, let the past be past! 
O, never seek to know the other! 
O, no! As yet, it would not do. 
O, nonsense! That's a thing for laughter; 
O, now am I sure of thee! 
O, what a blessed luck for thee!

Obedience, more than ever, claims he, 
Oberon, the beauteous fay, 
Obscuring Heaven's clear glow. 
Observe the time, and make it! 
Of God, the world and all that in it has a place, 
Of Man, and all that moves the being of his race, 
Of Medicine I still would fain 
     Of Science, still 
Of all I've seen, beyond compare; 
Of all the bold, denying Spirits, 
Of all the heavens the bright epitome? 
Of all things in the world! Just hear-- 
Of books worm-eaten, gray with dust, 
Of course. 
Of course! But only shun too over-sharp a tension, 
Of doubts or critic-cavils: 
Of every sin absolved; for I, 
Of flies and bed-bugs, frogs and lice, 
     Of foaming and flashing 
        Of his talk, the bliss 
Of human thought and knowledge mine, in vain; 
Of joyous days ye bring the blissful vision; 
Of lying to thyself in moderate measure. 
Of merry creatures so, then; 
Of name, and fame, and laurelled brow! 
Of oil, he paints the spot for thee:-- 
     Of old days, come faint and hollow. 
Of order and content around me whisper,-- 
Of quiet, order, and content! 
Of saying the things I do not know,-- 
        Of such an one! 
Of suns and worlds I've nothing to be quoted; 
Of the Four, no feature 
Of the qualities of his creation,-- 
Of these one covets some slight apprehension. 
Of this, our enterprise, in German land! 
Of well-trained voices, singing chorus; 
Of wings to lift the body can bequeath me. 
Of yearning onward, upward and away, 
Of youth collect, to hear the revelation! 
Off and about, 
Off in the world he went straightway,-- 
Off! or you're lost ere morn. 
Oh, if you hear me, answer me! 
Old gentlemen, why at the outskirts? Enter! 
Omniscient am I not; yet much is known to me. 
On Sundays, holidays, there's naught I take delight in, 
On _words_ let your attention centre! 
On earth a damned existence live! 
On fire each mountain-peak, with peace each valley filled, 
On gold depends 
On highest holidays might wear! 
On his bosom lie! 
On insecure foundation. 
On men so various: now, my friend, pray show it. 
On my account be kind, nor treat them rudely! 
On summer holidays to seek 
On the door-bench, in the passage dark, 
On the threshold he stood, and _Margaret_! calling, 
On words 'tis excellent believing; 
On your behalf, here, in my bosom grew; 
On your twin-pair, that feed among the roses. 
On! my shrinking but lingers Death more near. 
On! on! 
Once Heavenly Love sent down a burning kiss 
Once many a bit we sponged, but now, 
Once more, my friend, thou talkest sensibly. 
One at the window sits, with glass and friends, 
One carries home and then goes through it. 
One dares not that before chaste ears declare, 
One first perceives the bass is deep and strong. 
One has at once another air. 
One has one's hands full all the day and night; 
One impulse art thou conscious of, at best; 
One may possess them, well and good; 
One moment more I ask thee to remain, 
One must, at least, make this admission-- 
One of us, dost hear me! 
One only fear still needs repeating: 
One rapid glance within the mirror give me, 
One ruin whelm both her and me! 
One sees no tree, no glimpse of green, 
One sees that in nothing no interest he hath: 
One service pays the other thus. 
One should allow one's self to jest with ladies never. 
One soon fatigues, on woods and fields to look, 
One step, and thou art free at last! 
One that to her can a candle hold?" 
One with tenacious organs holds in love 
     One yearns, the rivers of existence, 
One yet in growth will ever grateful be. 
One's spirits, Sir, are thus not always good, 
One, when the play is out, goes home to cards; 
     Only believe there's a miracle here! 
Only by mass you touch the mass; for any 
Only fall to, and show no timid balking. 
Only he loved to roam and leave me, 
Only when meadow, field, and you are drowning. 
Only with slightly different phrases. 
Opposing substances agree. 
Or I'll blow out his being's flickering spark! 
Or I'll kiss thee! 
Or Mind, the wings uncloses, 
Or from behind struck down the adversary. 
Or how should there be devils? 
     Or if further we're ascending? 
Or oft, reluctant years its warrant sealing, 
     Or scratch them, day or night: 
Or snatch a rapid bliss in flying, 
Or, at the best, a Punch-and-Judy play, 
Or, in the spheres we dream of yonder, 
     Others are flying; 
     Others are sailing, 
Our Fatherland can best the sparkling cup replenish. 
Our converse here must be suspended. 
Our shoes are all danced out, we trow, 
Our thanks: we give the same. 
        Out of Corruption's womb: 
Out of the cellar-door, just now. 
Out of the hollow, gloomy gate, 
Out of this lonely life 
Out with your spit, without delay! 
Out yonder? 
Over her head and ears; 
Over me could give? 
Over the Spirits. 
Over the bridge, 
     Ow! ow! ow! ow!

Pardon the freedom I have ta'en,-- 
Pardon! With many questions I detain you. 
Pardon! a great delight is granted 
Pardon, I heard your declamation; 
Pardon, this troop I cannot follow after 
Paris in miniature, how it refines its people! 
Part of that Power, not understood, 
Part of the Darkness which brought forth the Light, 
Part of the Part am I, once All, in primal Night,-- 
     Pass as they hover; 
Past earthly joys he might secure. 
Patience must in the work be shown. 
Peal rather there, where tender natures dwell. 
(_Pedestrians of all kinds come forth_.) 
Perceiv'st thou yonder snail? It cometh, slow and steady; 
Perceived the noblest purpose of His trade, 
(_Perceiving the Animals_) 
(_Perceiving_ FAUST _and_ MEPHISTOPHELES.) 
Perchance my love, amid the childish band, 
Perhaps. 
Perhaps 'twas brought by some one as a pawn, 
Perhaps he's even dead! Ah, woe!-- 
Perhaps the very Devil, indeed! 
Perhaps you'll warmly take their part? 
Physics and Metaphysics both! 
     Pierced irredressibly! 
Pines, lest she hold as lost the man she loves so well! 
Plunge him in seas of sweet untruth! 
Plunge we in Time's tumultuous dance, 
Point your fingers and nip them all! 
Poison for such poor rats to scatter. 
Poodle, stop that howling, prithee! 
Poor Margaret flatter, and ensnare her, 
Poor Son of Earth, how couldst thou thus alone 
Posterity! Don't name the word to me! 
Poured speedy death, in poison glowing: 
(_Pours a glass of wine over_ BRANDER'S _head_.) 
Powder becomes, like petticoat, 
        Praising and pleading him, 
Pray'st thou for mercy on thy mother's soul, 
        Preaching and speeding him, 
Prepare beforehand for your part 
Presents at once? That's good: he's certain to get at her! 
Proclaimed the Spring's rejoicing holiday; 
Promise me, Henry!-- 
Promised them fullest heavenly pay, 
Prone at her feet, relaxed and tender! 
Propel the high poetic function, 
     Quakes the old hell-lynx there. 
Queer Son of Chaos, to begin! 
        Quem patronem rogaturus, 
Quick! lest our game escape us in the press: 
Quick, bring a light! 
        _Quid sum miser tunc dicturus, 
_Quid sum miser tune dicturus_? 
        Quidquid latet, ad parebit, 
Quiet he lies, and grins disdain: 
Quite right! The mark I also note. 
Quite virtuous, withal, I come,

Rat-catching piper, thou!--perdition! 
Ravished and rapt from life, had sunken! 
Reason and Knowledge only thou despise, 
Reason and sense forsake my brain, 
Reason becomes a sham, Beneficence a worry: 
Recall thy wandering will! 
Receive me now, I pray, as one 
Receive me, thou, that in thine open arms 
Receive the people's honest veneration! 
Reel off a host of threads before their faces, 
Reflect, soft wood is given to you for splitting, 
Refreshment shall his lips in vain implore-- 
Rejoiced am I that I may stay! 
Relate his life's sad close to me! 
Release me, now! I soon shall come again; 
Released from ice are brook and river 
Remains there naught of lofty spirit-sway, 
Renewed is Pain: with mournful repetition 
Reprobate! Name not that fairest thing, 
Rescue her, or woe to thee! The fearfullest curse be upon thee for 
Resembles a weaver's masterpiece, 
Rest not within mine arms to-night, 
Restless activity proves the man! 
Restrain thyself, thy sense and will 
Reveal thyself!

Room! and round about us, room! 
Round all, in wrathful energy.

    Salamander, shine glorious! 
_Sancta simplicitas_! no need of such a toil; 
Sang, God's new Covenant repeating? 
_Sans souci_, we call the clan

Save from the soul it rises clear, 
Save it! Save it! 
Save thy perishing child! 
Save what from thine own soul spontaneous breaks. 
Save your own heart is eloquent! 
Saved by your father's skillful hand, 
Saving Thy Gracious Presence, he to me 
Saw splendid lion-dollars in 't. 
Say, dost thou know, my friend, whom thou mak'st free? 
Say, how? Say, where? If buried, did he own it? 
Say, who would put his trust in nations, 
Say, who's the stiff and pompous man? 
Saying: I believe Him not! 
Saying: I believe in Him! 
Scarce through a glass, by rare occasion, 
Scattering through gardens and fields remote, 
Securely works his inspiration. 
See I with precision? 
See it, an elephant, expand! 
See that you most profoundly gain 
See the bagpipe on our track! 
See the wounds she has made me! 
     See them swiftly changing places, 
See what a vine! what grapes depending! 
See, here's the coat-of-arms that I am wearing! 
See, now, the race is happy--it is free!

See, what a delicate race they be! 
     See, what a wild and crazy throng! 
Seeing, hearing, and thinking leave me. 
Seek thou the honest recompense! 
Seek to confound your auditory! 
Seeketh a path 
Sees not the gardener, even while buds his tree, 
Seest thou the black dog coursing there, through corn and 
Seest thou the spiral circles, narrowing faster, 
Seize every possible impression, 
Seize it in haste! 
Seize me not thus so violently! 
Sense, Reason, Sentiment, and Passion join,-- 
Serene in primal strength, compelling 
Serpent! Serpent! 
Set wigs of million curls upon thy head, to raise thee, 
Shall I attempt, this once, to seize and bind ye? 
Shall I outlive this misery? 
  Shall be for me a harvest-day! 
Shall be within mine inmost being tested: 
Shall heap upon itself their bliss and sorrow, 
Shall not, henceforth, from any pang be wrested, 
Shall one believe no miracles, just say! 
Shall stand, with all my future days agreeing? 
Shall that a nosegay be? 
Shalt not in a golden chain array thee, 
Shalt not, in lace and ribbons flowing, 
Shalt soon experience the pleasure, 
Shalt thou sponge through the term beginning! 
Shame on thee!

She could not think, herself, of giving

She dwells within the dark, damp walls before me,

She falters on, her way scarce knowing, 
She feels that surely I'm a genius now,-- 
She has scored and has flayed me: 
She haunts her window, watching clouds that stray 
She in my mask a hidden sense would read: 
She is in secret brought to light, 
She is judged! 
She is not the first. 
         She is saved!

She showed me mine, in crystal clear,

She talks like one who raves in fever.

She'd take the Devil at his word, I fear. 
She's feeding two, whene'er she eats and drinks. 
She's played the fool at last, there's not a doubt.

Since Thou, O Lord, deign'st to approach again 
Since all that's coarse provokes my enmity. 
Since bravery was paid in fullest measure,

Since from the devils I also may 
Since he's installed, his arrogance grows faster. 
Since now it stands one in good stead.

Sir Baron call me thou, then is the matter good; 
Sir Doctor, don't retreat, I pray! 
Sir Doctor, it is good of you, 
Sir Microcosm his name should be.

Sit'st thou, as 'twere an owl a-blinking? 
Sits unrestful still, 
Smiling, the bumper in my hand: 
Snarl not, poodle! To the sound that rises, 
Snout of fly, mosquito-bill, 
So I am here with pleasure. 
So I sit naked on my goat, 
     So cannibalic jolly! 
So delicately its feelers pry, 
So fain I stay, when thou delayest! 
So free, so yielding, and so warm, 
So from its mother's breasts a child 
     So had I my reason. 
So here she guessed, from every gem, 
So humanly to gossip with the Devil! 
So innocent is she, indeed, 
So let us by the farce abide. 
So like the medicine, it baffles your detection. 
So long I make no prohibition. 
So long I stumble, ill bestead, 
So long as in my legs I feel the fresh existence. 
So long the host may credit give, 
So long the poor boy waits a hearing, 
So loving and ineffable,-- 
So many a midnight,--would thy glow 
So many days of life you drink! 
So mean and shameless was her behavior, 
So much have I already done for thee, 
So now I take thee into my keeping, 
So now her head no more she'll lift, 
So now, at the end, the flower is gone. 
  So red of cheek and fine of dress, 
So sit I, like the King upon his throne: 
So sweetly virtuous and pure, 
So that by wish and will you bend her; 
So that he felt it till his days were ended. 
So that it be a bran-new strain! 
So that the breeches have no creases! 
So that they gape in stupid wonder: then 
So the mouse was not gray, enough for thee. 
So this advice I bid thee heed-- 
So very dear was she. 
So weak and miserable she lay; 
So you but think a moment's space on me, 
So you can better watch, and look 
So, Friend (my views to briefly sum), 
So, by the burden of my days oppressed, 
So, dream thy dreams, O Faust, until we meet once more! 
So, here, we keep our good old fashions! 
So, oftentimes, you miserably mar it! 
So, take of traps and scenes your fill, 
So, these fine forces, in conjunction, 
So, to the actively eternal 
     _Soar up, soar up, Dame Nightingale! 
Soaring up, sweeping down, bowing and bending! 
Society to one's desire! 
        Solvet soeclum in favilla_! 
Some baubles I therein had placed, 
Some day, as bridegroom, home to bear her. 
     Some of them scaling 
     Some one, within, is caught! 
Some other labor seek thou rather, 
Some outlines of the tourney; 
Some pleasant news, at least, to tell me. 
Something beneath thy heart, 
Something immodest or unseemly free? 
Somewhat of cash, and healthy blood: 
Sons of Mieding, rest to-day! 
        _(Sound of the organ_.) 
     Sound of their quiring! 
Sound on, ye hymns of Heaven, so sweet and mild! 
     Sounds of hope, of love undying! 
Spare me! What have I done to thee? 
Speak not to me of yonder motley masses, 
Speak out, and make your choice with speed! 
Speak plainly, Sir, have you no one detected? 
Speak thy conditions plain and clear! 
Spider's foot and paunch of toad, 
Spirit of Contradiction! On! I'll follow straight. 
Spirit sublime, thou gav'st me, gav'st me all 
Spirits also, spirits come, 
Spirits, if you're here, be seen-- 
        Splendid the pay! 
        Splendid the pay! 
Spouses, who would fain agree, 
Spring from my commerce with the wilderness? 
Squander the stars in any number, 
Squeeze onward through the narrow gate of grace: 
Stand by: I'll lead, if you'll but tarry: 
Stand still, and you will see him wait; 
     Star of existent 
     Starlight is sparkling, 
Stay never hidden. 
     Stay without, follow him not! 
     Step forward, and finish thus! 
(_Steps back reverently, on seeing_ MARGARET.) 
        Still are we native here. 
Still in my feet the fright like lead is weighing. 
     Still increasing and expanding! 
Still many a man stands living here, 
Still o'er my heart is that illusion thrown? 
Still weaving its eternal secret, 
Still were he lost forevermore! 
Still wonder at your flights, enjoy the show they see: 
Still, fettered, unto bodies cleaves: 
        Stormy our life is; 
     Stream and streamlet seek the hollow. 
Such a demand alarms me not: 
Such a noisy, disturbing fellow 
Such a reproach not in the least offends; 
Such an enamored fool in air would blow 
Such dilettants!--perdition! 
        Such is its boon! 
Such is my world: and what a world! 
Such is the everlasting song 
Such taking-on of airs! 
Such things? Never beheld I aught so fair! 
Such time I've squandered o'er the history: 
Such to encounter is not good: 
Such treasures have I, and can show them. 
Such works are held as antiquate and mossy; 
Sucks melancholy food from your creation; 
Suggest their own delivery; 
Summons thee hither to the door-sill, 
Sun, moon, and all the starry legions, 
     Suns are on high. 
Superbly from the arches o'er us. 
Surely a gallant man was he, 
Surely for his soul's sake full many a prayer I'll proffer. 
Sways like a harp-string by the breezes fanned. 
Sweep down, and with their barbéd points assail you; 
Sweeps an infuriate glamouring song! 
Sweet darling! 
  Sweet innocent, thou art! 
Sweet pain of love, bind thou with fetters fleet 
Swift from the North the spirit-fangs so sharp

That I could not be angrier with you. 
That I may detect the inmost force 
That I nor Chancellor nor Kaiser be. 
That I so boldly introduce me, 
That I the sense may not have fairly tested. 
That also with them goes material for thinking! 
That arbitrarily, here, ourselves we isolate. 
That arm and escort I would lend you! 
That binds the Noble and Mean together. 
That brain, alone, not loses hope, whose choice is

That burns within me like a flame, 
That cross me, drawing hither and thither

That fell asleep to long, long torment, and through thee? 
That for our help he long may abide! 
That from her gaze I cannot tear me! 
That from the cradle to the bier 
That ghosts can't stand on ordinary foundation? 
That he the rattling chain, the rustling straw, can hear. 
That her salvation is,--with scruples holy 
That in the dance so sweetly sang? 
That in the ears of all men rings,-- 
That in the greater world the little worlds are made. 
That is all the scenery. 
That is my proper element. 
That is no little space: what say'st thou, friend?

That many a secret perchance I reach

That naught is said but what is in the book: 
That not alone your thirst is slake,-- 
That not much blessing came with them. 
That nothing can be perfect unto Man 
That now I vanish, pardon, I entreat you! 
That now _thy_ stream all shallow shows. 
That now her husband's limbs, outstretched and pallid, 
That now our day of joy you share,

That scarce the world on holidays can see,-- 
That scarcely more is left me to fulfil. 
That seemed to be a chain of pearl. 
That sire or son such praises merit! 
That snatched him from the fever's rage

That something's wrong, I feel suspicious. 
That springing flies, and flying springs,

That were to venture far, indeed. 
That wheresoe'er he meets us, even,

That which the dainty spirits sing thee, 
That which to Naught is in resistance set,--

That you have not the Roman realm to care for! 
That you may see how much I'd fain 
That you might win another by it. 
That you your heart with slander harden!

That's no great luck for me, 'tis plain. 
That's not enough: we must believe thereon. 
That's nothing! One must not so squeamish be; 
That's well! So might a compact be

The art is old and new, for verily

(_The caldron, which the_ SHE-APE _has up to this time neglected 
     The child is stifled, the mother bursts. 
The choice is free: make up your minds. 
The circle narrows: he is near! 
The circle of Creation will appear, 
The cither's smashed! For nothing more 'tis fitting. 
The clever scholar of the students, he! 
The clock may stop, the hand be broken, 
The cloth upon thy board bids smoothly thee unroll, 
        The coaxing shun 
The cohorts of Hell! 
The colors of hope to the valley cling, 
     The cook laid poison cunningly, 
The cooking, early work and late, in fact; 
The country's custom is not so. 
The courage of the lion's breed, 
The crane sails by to other shores. 
The crazy stuff, the gestures frantic,-- 
The crooked jump, the heavy skip, 
The crowd for strongest drink is panting, 
The crowd is thronging, no word is spoken: 
The crown of all humanity to win me, 
     The crown to belime! 
     The damnéd beast--the curséd sow! 
(_The dance continues_) 
The darling's sorrow gives me pain. 
The day dawns: Dearest! Dearest! 
The days of that old Northern phantom now are over: 
_The dear old holy Roman realm, 
The dear, familiar phantoms rise again, 
The dear, good man! Long since was he forgiven. 
The dearest child of Faith is Miracle. 
The death-bell tolls, the wand is broken. 
     The deeds of passion cease to chain; 
The deep, mysterious miracles unfold. 
The deepest gorges, faint and wan. 
The depths of being only prizes. 
The dog, when he's well educated, 
The door is open, art free to go. 
The dream of drink shall mock, but never lave him: 
     The dreary moon forsakes the sky; 
The elements of Life how conquers he? 
The end of that far-spreading death 
The evergreen palaces shaking! 
The fact is easy to unravel, 
The fairest stars from Heaven he requireth, 
The faith alone 
The few, who thereof something really learned, 
The fiddle stops, the dance delays. 
          The fiddle-bow was playing. 
The finest lasses and the best of beer, 
     The fire-pain 
The first is free to us; we're governed by the second. 
The first was not a great display. 
The first was so, the second so, 
The flame they follow, on and on, 
     The fool knows it not! 
The foreign people are a-fighting. 
The form diviner beings wear! 
The fortune of this hour embitter! 
The garment of Life which the Deity wears! 
The gentle movement of Thy Day. 
The gentleman is pleased to jest. 
The gentleman's too kind, I'm sure. 
The giant firs, in falling, neighbor boughs 
The girls have much desire to ascertain 
The glorified, from thee: 
The glow retreats, done is the day of toil; 
     The grapes are juicy, the vines are wood, 
        The grave is here; 
The graves tremble! 
The green-embosomed houses glitter! 
The half are coarse, the half are cold. 
The hallowed Original 
The hand that wields the broom on Saturdays 
The haughty Light, which now disputes the space, 
The heart that on the dew of hope must pine! 
        The heart within me breaks. 
The hearts and minds of all who hear. 
The highest favor Love lets fall! 
The highest right, supreme Humanity, 
The highest strength in man that lies! 
The highest, lowest forms my soul shall borrow, 
The hope, from Error's deeps to rise forever! 
        The house I quit. 
The jewels don't belong to me. 
     The joke will pass, 
The knave is outlawed! Cut him as you like! 
The ladies with themselves, and with their finery, aid, 
     The lamp with friendly lustre glows, 
The lamp's extinguished!-- 
The lark sends down his flickering lay,-- 
The last full wherry takes the stream. 
The learned gentleman I bow before: 
The length of the time they'd never mark. 
The like of thee have never moved My hate. 
The lip so red, the cheek's clear dawn, 
The little god o' the world sticks to the same old way, 
The little world, and then the great, we'll see. 
     The lofty skill 
The lofty works, uncomprehended, 
The look, the manner, both betray-- 
The lord of rats and eke of mice, 
The loss of thee were truly very slight,-- 
     The love of God revives again. 
     The love of Man revives within us, 
The love of this young silly blood 
The lovely land of wine, and song, and slumber. 
The lovely pictures they shall bring thee, 
     The magic notes, like spark on spark, 
     The maids were bitten and bled. 
        The man who with thee goes, thy mate, 
The massy pillars 
The meteor that a moment dances,-- 
The might of Man, as in the Bard revealed. 
The modest truth I speak to thee. 
The monkey! Is she gone? 
The monster without air or rest, 
The moon conceals her light-- 
The moon's lone disk, with its belated glow, 
The more she seeks the day's broad light. 
        The morning sun shone red: 
The morning twilight is near. 
The mother saw them, and, instanter, 
The motley throngs come forth elate: 
The mountain-chain, with all its gorges deep, 
The murderers, whither have they run? 
The narrow being suits me not at all. 
The new-born impulse fires my mind,-- 
The night is falling. 
The night with the mist is black; 
The noble Sir should find it good, 
The noble indolence I'll teach thee then to treasure, 
The ocean-tides in foam are breaking, 
The one almighty force enduring,-- 
The one who brought such things to me." 
The one who just went by. 
The other strongly sweeps, this dust above, 
The other, then, its place may fill. 
The outer angle, you may see, 
The pack of devils by no rules is daunted: 
        The pangs that wring my flesh and bone! 
The pentagram prohibits thee? 
The poising eagle slowly soars, 
The poodle naught remarked, as after thee he speeded; 
The poor wee thing its natural living; 
The poor, poor thing! 
The posts are set, the booth of boards completed. 
        The pots before my window, 
        The power of his eyes, 
The powers of Nature here, around my path, revealing? 
The promise that I make to thee 
The proper folks one's talents laud: 
The proverb says: One's own warm hearth 
The pure, their hands to offer, 
The purer joys that round the Poet throng,-- 
The purest bliss was surely then thy dower. 
     The queen she got them upon her, 
The rabble by such hate are held, 
The ranks of living creatures thou dost lead 
The rest a bold address will win you; 
The restless, ruddy gold hast thou, 
The right born with us, ours in verity, 
The rocky ramparts blazing stand. 
The roots are twisting asunder! 
The rustling leaves through chill autumnal vapor! 
The sacred tones that my soul embrace, 
The same thing, in all places, 
The same tough meat have chewed and tested, 
The sand beneath thy feet makes whiter, crisper. 
     The scattered 
The scholars are everywhere believers, 
The secret horror of him returneth; 
The shadows thus within my bosom gather. 
The shameless murderers praised at last! 
The sign witness now, 
The silent world beneath me glowing, 
The silver brook to golden rivers flowing. 
The silvery phantoms of the ages past, 
        The smile of his mouth, 
The solace this, whereof he's most assured: 
The soulless sneak disturbs me thus! 
The souls, to whom my earliest songs I sang: 
The special faculty you seek. 
"The spirit-world no closures fasten; 
The splendid sole adornment of her hair! 
The splendor of the world goes round, 
The spring-time stirs within the fragrant birches, 
The square below 
The stock is rare and various. 
The strength of Hate, Love's deep devotion,-- 
The strongest art within my hands! 
     The stubble is yellow, and green the crop. 
The stubborn rocks before me 
The sturdiest he-goat I would gladly see: 
The sun-orb sings, in emulation, 
The surer, afterwards, to cheat her. 
The sweet young maiden to betray, 
        The sword Thy heart in, 
     The tailor came straightway: 
The tempest whistles and surges! 
The temple-halls of Certainty. 
The tender bosom filled and fair, 
The terms with graver, quill, or chisel, stated? 
The third and fourth had never been. 
The thraldom of thy woe to sever. 
The thread of Thought at last is broken, 
The threefold dazzling glow! 
The threshold under, 
The throats are tuned, commence! 
The time I verily can discern 
The time is long: thou need'st not now insist. 
The timid lips have stammeringly expressed,-- 
The touching of her lips, before the altar. 
        The towns in his land he told, 
The tree-trunks terribly thunder, 
The trinkets left for Margaret! 
The trouble's small, the fun is great. 
The true witch-element we learn. 
The trumpet peals! 
The uglier she is to sight, 
The vaulted arches 
     The very founts of Life, to reach. 
The villain! From his children thieving! 
The waggish knave least trouble doth create. 
     The way is wide, the way is long: 
The way we take, our goal is yet some distance. 
The whirlpool swirls to get above: 
The wider circle he acquires, the more 
     The wild desires no longer win us, 
The wild stag's speed, 
The wilful summer-birds! 
     The wind is hushed, the star shoots by. 
The window's here, the door is yonder; 
     The witch she-----s, and-----s the buck. 
     (The witch's tricks) 
     The witches ride to the Brocken's top, 
The wizard's-foot, that on your threshold made is. 
The woe of earth, the bliss of earth, invite me, 
The woe, the rapture, so ensnare me, 
     The wooden table gives wine as good! 
The word, alas! dies even in the pen, 
The words you've bandied are sufficient; 
The work of sorrow! 
        The world is gall 
     The world's the ball: 
The world's, as well, must soon be ended. 
The worst society thou find'st will show thee 
The years a double strength produce. 
The young Queen in her crystal shell, 
(_The_ THREE ARCHANGELS _come forward_.) 
(_The_ WITCH _breaks the circle_: FAUST _steps forth_.) 
(_The_ WITCH, _with many ceremonies, pours the drink into a 
Thee and thy monkey-sprites with fell disaster? 
Thee into the mob thou hatest! 
Thee, boundless Nature, how make thee my own? 
Thee, form of flame, shall I then fear? 
Thee, me, Himself? 
Thee, superhuman, shakes? Thy soul's high calling, where? 
Thee, too!--'Tis thou! It scarcely true doth seem-- 
Their air's so odd, they've just returned from travel: 
Their blank, set stare benumbs the human blood, 
Their clothes are colors that softly gleam. 
Their everlasting aches and groans, 
Their golden urns reciprocally lending, 
          Their kirtles all were playing. 
Their properties 
Their very plaudits give my heart a pang, 
Themselves, their holy value, and their spell! 
Then 'tis the same as were the step not made; 
     Then Hope again lends sweet assistance, 
Then I received, as was most fit, 
Then I suggest, 'twere fair and just 
Then Time be finished unto me! 
Then a great public you can show. 
Then again quiet she appears,--Always 
Then also take the finest can, 
Then also you, though but a youth, 
Then art thou from thy service free! 
Then at the Doctors'-banquet I, to-day, 
Then at the wash-tub stand, at morning's break; 
Then bagged the spangles, chains, and rings, 
Then bind me in thy bonds undying, 
Then bright mist veiled the world before me, 
Then cease to bore us at our ball! 
Then climb the rocky ramparts yonder, 
Then close at her side my brother, 
        Then fell his eyelids forever, 
     Then follow the witches, every one. 
Then from the East they come, to dry and warp 
Then give me back that time of pleasures, 
     Then honor to whom the honor is due! 
Then house-right I must use, and clear the way. 
Then how shall we begin? 
     Then laughed the murderess in her glee: 
Then let the death-bell chime the token. 
Then let thyself be taught, say I! 
     Then lower, and on the ground alight; 
Then may delight and distress, 
Then may his teaching cheerfully impel thee: 
Then may thine own son afterwards excel thee. 
Then parry that! 
Then pluck up heart, and give us sterling coin! 
Then range with all my senses through creation, 
          Then round the circle went their flight, 
Then saw I--. 
Then shalt thou do the same for me. 
Then show'st me mine own self, and in my breast 
Then soon will others come to thee, 
Then stand abashed, when thou art forced to say: 
Then the parts in his hand he may hold and class, 
Then thou believest not! 
Then thou, at will, mayst question and compel me. 
Then through the air direct our courses. 
Then through the safest gate you'll enter 
Then thus: "In the Beginning was the _Thought_" 
Then to the cave secure thou leadest me, 
Then to thine aid the witch must call. 
     _Then was I a beautiful bird o' the wood; 
Then wear the crown, and show it, 
Then why not I, in mine, as well? 
Then winter nights take loveliness untold, 
Then would I see eternal Evening gild 
Then you have reached the right place now. 
Then, as a greeting, you are free to touch and test them, 
Then, at your play, behold the fairest flower 
Then, self-contented, _Bravo_! says, 
Then, the philosopher steps in 
Then, too, I've neither lands nor gold, 
Then, too, thou honorest not the Holy Sacraments. 
Then, too, when night descends, how anxiously 
Then, worthy Sir, improve betimes your chances! 
_Then_ was the real golden age. 
There com'st thou, hopping on to me! 
There fire and whirling smoke I see. 
There flames a desolation, blazing 
     There gathers the crowd for carnival: 
There hoe and dig, as thy condition; 
There is a lively club together: 
There is, again, thy proper tone!-- 
There is, to make thee young, a simpler mode and apter; 
There let, at once, my record end! 
     There lies the brew! 
     There lies the glass! 
There must be such queer birds, however. 
There never was a sweeter fool than mine, 
There sits my mother upon a stone, 
There sits my mother upon a stone,-- 
        There stood the old carouser, 
        There was a King in Thule, 
There was a Lion red, a wooer daring, 
There was a king once reigning, 
     There was a king once reigning, 
     There was a rat in the cellar-nest, 
There will your mind be drilled and braced, 
There's an old story has the same refrain; 
There's blood thereon. 
There's both together! 
There's nothing special of my own to show! 
There's so much secret poison lurking in 't, 
There's yet a skull I must be splitting! 
There, also, comes no rest to me, 
There, in a corner pressed and sundered, 
There, now, is thine antipathy! 
Therefore I'd never love, believe me! 
Therefore I've worn, like many a spindly youth, 
Therefore the third and fourth are so; 
     Therein I saw a cloven tree, 
Therein I've borne so much probation! 
Therein thou'rt free, according to thy merits; 
Thereto I willingly agree, 
These are the musicians! 
These are the small dependants 
These chants, to youth and all its sports appealing, 
These crazy signs of witches' craft repel me! 
(These elements),-- 
These ten years long, with many woes, 
They are jesting, shameless! 
They are newly plighted. 
They come to look, and they prefer to stare. 
They crowd and push, they roar and clatter! 
They dance, they chat, they cook, they drink, they court: 
          They danced to left, they danced to right: 
(_They draw their knives, and rush upon_ MEPHISTOPHELES.) 
(_They drink repeatedly_.) 
They feel, themselves, their resurrection: 
          They first grew red, and then grew warm, 
They gladly hearken, prompt for injury,-- 
They go their way with looks demure, 
(_They handle the crown awkwardly and break it into two 
They hear no longer these succeeding measures, 
     They lured me so, I climbed thereon. 
They merrily and careless live. 
They never yet have been so pert and saucy. 
(_They pass in the city-gate_.) 
[_They pass_. 
[_They pass_. 
[_They pass_. 
[_They pass_. 
They praise us half in pity, sure: 
They prate and teach, and no one interferes; 
They rave, as Satan were their sports controlling. 
They scatter, devote and doom! 
They seek the Evil One in wild confusion: 
(_They settle down_.) 
They shine, and spirt, and stink, and burn! 
They sing songs about me! 'tis bad of the folk to do it! 
They sit sedate, and hope to be amazed. 
(_They stand amazed and look at each other_.) 
They start another dance: come now, let us take hold! 
They still are moved at once to weeping or to laughter, 
They swear and storm, they yell and fight! 
They took 't away, to vex me, maybe, 
They turn their faces, 
They whirl and whistle, pull and chatter! 
They whirl in narrow, circling trails, 
They will even say, at last, 
They would persuade thee. 
They're from the Rhine! I guessed as much, before. 
They're mountebanks, upon a revel. 
They're now too far from what is just and sage. 
They're of a noble house, that's very clear: 
They're poets, genuine and sincere. 
They've danced already more than fitting. 
     They, with their glowing 
Thine am I, Father! rescue me! 
Thine earthly self behind thee cast, 
Thine endless love, thy faith assuring, 
Thine obligation newly earning. 
Thine own ecstatic life on all things shower, 
     Things are badly controlled, 
Things worsen,--what improvement names he? 
Thinks on the jewels, day and night, 
This and the other question, at your pleasure. 
This bestial noise is out of place. 
This drear, accursed masonry, 
This drink will bring my friend no injuries: 
This eve we'll expect the gentlemen. 
This fiddling, shouting, ten-pin rolling 
This first line let me weigh completely, 
This is a fair, as never was another! 
     This is the witch's once-one's-one! 
This knotted staff suffices me. 
This life of earth, whatever my attire, 
This miracle alone can work the Poet 
This nursing of the pain forego thee, 
This once, the fancy wrought in me 
This poverty what bounty blesses! 
This racking fuss on every hand, 
This round and round the world in freedom sweeping; 
This time, I'll let thee 'scape the debt; 
This time, thine eyes be satiate! 
This to consider, there's, alas! no hurry. 
This was the medicine--the patients' woes soon ended, 
This was the poodle's real core, 
This, aged Sirs, belongs to you, 
Those two, the old one with the young one sitting, 
Those, dressed so prettily and neatly. 
Thou angel, fear it not! 
Thou art a dear, good-hearted man, 
Thou art a grandchild, therefore woe to thee! 
Thou art a man among the rest. 
Thou art, and thou remain'st, a sophist, liar. 
Thou busy Spirit, how near I feel to thee! 
Thou canst not compass general ruin, 
Thou canst! Just will it! Open stands the door. 
Thou crav'st the same illusion still! 
Thou dar'st not tell the youngsters--never! 
Thou darest not tell me so in earnest. 
Thou fool, go in and comfort her! 
Thou gav'st me Nature as a kingdom grand, 
Thou gav'st the comrade, whom I now no more 
Thou goest away! O Henry, if I could go! 
Thou goest, they stand in rows to see, 
Thou hast a perfect right thereto. 
     Thou hast it destroyed, 
Thou hast no doubt about my noble blood: 
Thou hast the moral right to cry me "shame!" at present. 
Thou hast therewith so filled and drowned her, 
        Thou lookest up to where Thy Son is slain! 
Thou must begin to-morrow 
Thou must! thou must! and though my life it cost me! 
Thou nam'st thyself a part, yet show'st complete to me? 
Thou pimp most infamous, be still! 
        Thou seest the Father; 
Thou seest, not vain the threats I bring thee: 
Thou shalt abstain--renounce--refrain! 
Thou shalt live. 
Thou shouldst not find it so annoying, 
Thou soon shalt see, alive and warm. 
        Thou sorrow-laden, 
        Thou sorrow-laden, 
Thou sweet, angelic soul! 
Thou wilt unloose my chain, 
Thou wouldst be devil enough to grudge my soul the blessing. 
Thou'lt find each day a greater rapture bringing. 
Thou'lt find, this drink thy blood compelling, 
Thou'lt hear a masterpiece, no work completer: 
Thou'lt hear much more before we leave her. 
Thou'rt also free to all the town. 
Thou'rt come for me at midnight-hour: 
Thou'rt like the Spirit which thou comprehendest, 
Thou'rt shoved thyself, imagining to shove. 
Thou'rt shown to all the younger generation: 
Thou, Hell, hast claimed this sacrifice as thine! 
Thou, Spirit of the Earth, art nearer: 
Thou, else, dost well the devil-nature wear: 
Thou, full of sensual, super-sensual desire, 
Thou, monster, wilt nor see nor own 
Thou, who around the wide world wendest, 
Though I be glowing with her kisses, 
Though I were ne'er so far, it cannot falter: 
Though guessed the holy symbols be: 
Though our acquaintance is so recent, 
Though some familiar tone, retrieving 
Though still by them uncomprehended, 
Though still confused his service unto Me, 
Though ugly faces he allure, 
     Thousand-colored, herd-wise hieing 
Thousands were done to death from poison of my giving; 
Three hundred masses buy, to save him from perdition! 
Three years is but a little space. 
                  Thrice must the words be spoken. 
Throbs to life! 
     Through all Heaven impermeate, 
Through flat and stale indifference; 
Through his nostrils double! 
Through honey-dew and fragrance: 
Through spirit-power and spirit-speech, 
Through the impervious veil it wore! 
     Through the moss and through the heather! 
     Through the sand and boulders toiling, 
Through this insane, chaotic play? 
Thrust home! 
Thus at Time's humming loom 'tis my hand prepares 
Thus in desire I hasten to enjoyment, 
        Thus is He here! 
        Thus is the Master near,-- 
Thus shall you hit the mark of gain and glory. 
Thus the best beverage is supplied, 
                   Thus thou pleasest me. 
Thus we, our hellish boluses compounding, 
Thus, all which you as Sin have rated,-- 
Thus, at the breasts of Wisdom clinging, 
Thus, in our booth's contracted sphere, 
Thy business thus to slight: 
Thy cap and mantle straightway lend me! 
Thy cries will wake the guards, and they will seize thee! 
Thy dear, dear hand!--But, ah, 'tis wet! 
     Thy doom is spoken! 
Thy fancy's rickets plague thee not at all: 
        Thy gracious countenance upon my pain! 
Thy guilty heart shall then dismay thee. 
Thy head is out of order, sadly: 
Thy life disquieting 
Thy mother will not see, and stories we'll invent. 
Thy nerves of touch ecstatic glow! 
Thy palate then with taste delighted, 
Thy passion! 
Thy powerful yearning moveth me, 
Thy prayers didst prattle, 
        Thy sad sighs gather, 
Thy scent will be to bliss invited; 
Thy sense is shut, thy heart is dead: 
Thy steps through life, I'll guide thee,-- 
Thy wish be on Walpurgis Night expressed; 
Thy words will slay me! 
Thyself hast led thyself into the meshes. 
Thyself to Godhood haughtily inflating; 
Till darkness closes from the sky! 
Time, only, strengthens the fine fermentation. 
'Tis I! 
'Tis I! 
'Tis I! Come on! 
Tis Lilith. 
Tis all so cramped and close and mean; 
'Tis all the same: the book I can repeat, 
'Tis deeds that I prefer to see: 
     'Tis done, let it be! 
'Tis easily displayed, and easy to invent. 
'Tis enough: ascend no higher,-- 
     'Tis finished straight! 
'Tis for your sweetheart's room you're bound, 
     'Tis given unsought, unbidden! 
'Tis he! 'tis he! Where now is all my pain? 
'Tis honor, profit, unto me. 
'Tis long since thou hast been to mass or to confession. 
'Tis lucky thou hast seen the sight; 
     'Tis made of clay, 
Tis magic all, thou fool, seduced so easily! 
'Tis magic! Strike-- 
'Tis no companion of Delay. 
'Tis planned most wisely, if I judge aright: 
'Tis some strange gentleman.--Come in! 
'Tis struggling still! 
'Tis the absurdest, drollest beast. 
'Tis the soap-blown bubble: 
      'Tis thou! O, say it once again! 
'Tis thou! Thou comest to save me, 
     'Tis thoughts, and we're thinking! 
'Tis thy mother's son! 
             Tis time to separate. 
'Tis too early yet. 
'Tis true, she showed me, on Saint Andrew's Night, 
'Tis truly wonderful! What can within it be? 
'Tis trying to rise, 
Tis vain, this empty brooding here, 
'Tis verily full many a day now. 
  'Tis very fine! 
'Tis very hard to shun the false direction; 
'Tis very well! _My_ envy oft reposes 
'Tis very well, that once one tries the stuff, 
Tis well. 
'Tis winter still within my body: 
'Tis written on his very forehead 
'Tis written: "In the Beginning was the _Word_." 
To Him above bow down, my friends, 
To Life it now renews the old allegiance. 
To bathe thy breast in morning-red!" 
To be far beastlier than any beast. 
To be our peer, with us, the Spirits, banded? 
To bear false witness in a case? 
To bore thyself and bore the students? 
To bring no gift when her I visit. 
To change this hut into a lower heaven! 
To change to my beloved German. 
     To cheer the witch will salve avail; 
To classify them for your using. 
To clear the folly out, how have I swept and stirred! 
To curb my temperament unstable; 
To deck therewith my darling girl? 
To don the self-same gay apparel, 
     To entrap us, unresisted: 
To fiery torments 
To find an opportune occasion. 
To follow servant-girls, when they 
To freedom. 
To get a ticket break their necks almost. 
To give his sweetheart a diverting show. 
To give that number is the custom here: 
To gnaw it where, with just a morsel 
To gold still tends, 
To grasp the spirit of Medicine is easy: 
To greet and know the man of fame, 
To grub with yearning force through Earth's dark marrow, 
To have a dear thing for one's caressing. 
To head and heart, the force, 
To health in thy dewy fountains bathe me! 
To hear it thus, it may seem passable; 
To hear your wisdom thoroughly expounded? 
        To heart's desire, 
To help or convert a fellow-creature. 
     To him 'tis brought, 
To his neck will I fly, 
To honor the Day of the Risen Lord! 
To lead the women, learn the special feeling! 
To leave my wife, my trade, in manner so ungrateful! 
     To leave the kettle, and singe the Frau! 
To leave them is my inclination. 
To let it go at last, so please ye, 
To let thee see how smooth life runs away. 
To lift the kettle with its treasure. 
To love by rule, and hate by measure! 
To madness and to horror, sure. 
To maim and slay delights them: 
To manage witches, this is just the way. 
To me it is a proper art 
        To meet him, him only, 
To most exactly measure, sew and shear, 
To my impertinence befitting, 
To no one hope of mine--not one--its promise keeping:-- 
To order rigidly adhere; 
To overcome the poets and the devils. 
To plague my day auspicious thou returnest. 
To play,--with grace and bold expression, 
To ply the pimp and gypsy trade! 
To quench the fervors of glowing passion! 
To rate with gibes a scolder; 
To reach the seller's box, a fighting host, 
To restless action spurs our fate! 
To satisfy them is a task.-- 
To see him now I have no heart. 
        To see him, him only, 
To see the day of disappointment break, 
To share with him the pleasure. 
To smash her windows be a greeting! 
To some from out our cellar's treasure. 
(_To some, who are sitting around dying embers_:) 
To spare the lovely day your lust, 
To stick in shallow trash forevermore,-- 
To stroll with you, Sir Doctor, flatters; 
To swallow up each ranter, 
To take the spade in hand, and ply it. 
To taste, I know not what, in haughty power, 
(_To the Animals_) 
(_To the Animals_) 
To the Devil, first, the instrument! 
To the Devil, then, the curst musician! 
     To the enticing 
To the lecture-hall you were forced to go,-- 
To the left, where the plank is placed 
To the mount of roses! 
(_To the revellers_) 
     To the singing of thy crew. 
To thee, of all earth's sons the poorest, dullest! 
To trap him, let thy snares be planted, 
To view me is thine aspiration, 
To waft me o'er the world at pleasure, 
To walk with many a sweet digression,-- 
        To whom his mistress, dying, 
To wind the world in unison with him? 
To work, at once! The point which made me craven 
To yield one wholly, and to feel a rapture 
To-day you're like wet straw, so tame; 
To-morrow, though, I'll ask, in Easter leisure, 
(_To_ FAUST, _who has left the dance_:) 
(_To_ FROSCH.) 
(_To_ MARGARET) 
Toad-like, thy nourishment alone? 
Tokay shall flow at once, to fill you! 
Too old am I to play with passion; 
Too young, to be without desire. 
Torn lies the wreath, scattered the blossoms are. 
     Tranquiller-hearted 
Transform him again into his favorite likeness, that he may crawl upon 
     Trees and rocks with grinning faces, 
     Trees on trees beside us trooping, 
Trembles through all the depths of being, 
          Trials that tested him, 
Trodden are the grasses: 
True, child is child, and play is play. 
True, with the child a troubled life I led, 
Truly the fabric of mental fleece 
Trust me, dear heart! what men call sensible 
Trust one of us, this Whole supernal 
Try, then, the open window-pane! 
Turn off this spirit from his fountain-head; 
Turn out who quarrels--out the door! 
Turn thee about, and from this height 
Twas Perseus lopped it, her old adversary. 
'Twas all deceit, and lying, false design! 
'Twas by a Dilettante written, 
'Twas kissing and coddling, on and on! 
'Twas something better than manure,-- 
'Twas sure an old Greek tragedy you read? 
'Twere better if for novelties thou sendest: 
'Twere better, then, were naught created. 
'Twere easier groping forward, truly. 
Twice a swine! 
Twill ne'er be clean: why, 'tis a thing unheard! 
'Twill plod along the path of thought, 
                 'Twill shortly recommence: 
'Twill warm thy heart with new desire: 
'Twixt Heaven and Earth on potent errands fleeing, 
Two souls, alas! reside within my breast, 
'Twould be my death upon the spot! 
'Twould bring, for all my sinful pleasure, 
'Twould go to the priest, as did the other. 
'Twould only make the people shun me; 
     Under and over, 
Under the old ribs of the rock retreating, 
Under the steps beside us, 
     Undine! 
Uninterrupted gushed and sprang! 
Unqualified repose he learns to crave; 
Unseen the threads are knit together. 
Until, self-pleased, myself I see,-- 
Unto a neighbor she must go, 
Unto each man his love she seems to be. 
        Unto no thief 
     Unto the knight with cloven foot! 
Unwearied, for that fair and lovely form: 
Unwisely frank, with hearts that spurned concealing, 
Up and away! 
Up by the brook, 
Up! holla! ho! 
(_Upon a low hearth stands a great caldron, under which a fire 
Upon its track to follow, follow soaring! 
Upon my brow, in Sabbath silence holy; 
Upon my couch of sleep I lay me: 
Upon my path I wish for frost and snow. 
Upon our German stage, you know it, 
Upon the verge of bitter weeping, 
Upon the world, and on mankind. 
Upon thy threshold whose the blood? 
Upward th'eternal lamp sends forth a glimmer, 
Us as little insects see! 
Use both the great and lesser heavenly light,-- 
Use well your time! It flies so swiftly from us; 
Useless talking, delaying and praying!

Wait a while! 
Wait not to know 
Wait not to know 
Walk up and down an hour, before the mirror yonder,-- 
Walked thyself off this earthly ball 
     Wandering lights that spin in mazes, 
        Was faithful till the grave,-- 
Was it a God, who traced this sign, 
Was it not given to thee and me? 
Was that your nose I tightened? 
Waste not a day in vain digression: 
    Wave, Undine, as bidden! 
     Waveringly bending, 
          Waylaying and betraying! 
We also were not stupid, either, 
We are so wise, and yet is Tegel haunted. 
We are used to see, that Man despises 
We call the Supernatural to guide us; 
We climb the Brocken's top in the Walpurgis-Night, 
     We crack them and we crush them, 
     We crack them and we crush them, 
     We do not measure with such care: 
We fill with fresh wine, for your sake: 
We have no maid: I do the knitting, sewing, sweeping, 
     We hear and we rhyme! 
We made a Turkish merchantman our prey, 
We mark how, ere our times, a sage has thought, 
We must arrange them now, more wisely, 
We must make use of strategy. 
We passed, without a call, to-day. 
We pine and thirst for Revelation, 
We shall be made to dearly rue it. 
We shall meet once again, 
     We speak and we see, 
          We tenderly laid him: 
We will no longer lose a minute; 
We'll have our private joy thereon. 
We'll saunter to the Mill, in yonder hollow. 
We'll spread this cloak with proper art, 
We'll surely find him by those poplars yonder. 
We'll talk about the matter soon. 
We'll try a wider sphere. 
We're cooking watery soup for beggars. 
We're for the Hunters' lodge, to-day. 
We're here together, so begin! 
We're only genuine children still, in Age's season! 
We've but naked soles to run with. 
We've but to make a deposition valid 
We've just retraced our way from. Spain, 
We've too much tact and policy 
We've washed, and are bright as ever you will, 
        We, his aspiring 
     We, it seems, have entered newly 
We, more than others, might take comfort, rather: 
Wear shoes an ell in height,--the truth betrays thee, 
        Weeping, desiring, 
Well said! and out with him that takes the least offence! 
Well! I'll engage to let thee be: 
Well, Margaret soon will still your yearning: 
Well, we'll consider: thou canst gather 
Well, well! That might have done, however, 
Well, well,--to-night--? 
Well,--Chance, this time, has fairly hit it! 
Well-made you are, 'tis not to be denied, 
Went into every house of pain: 
"Were I a little bird!" so runs her song, 
Were I in _your_ place, do not doubt me, 
Were but the ear-rings mine, alone! 
Were not the first and second, then 
     Were plagued, awake and in bed; 
     Wert thou the thief, 
What? 
What I can! 
What I possess, I see far distant lying, 
What a spectre I've harbored thus! 
What ails thee? What is't gripes thee, elf? 
What ails you now? Is't suffering, or pleasure? 
What am I, then, if 'tis denied my part 
What are, within her arms, the heavenly blisses? 
What bliss within this narrow den is pent! 
What boon I have, shall then be given unto thee. 
What dazzles, for the Moment spends its spirit: 
What do I see? What heavenly form revealed 
What does he want in this holy spot? 
What does not suit the human brain! 
        What dost thou here 
What dreams are yours in high poetic places? 
What every journeyman within his wallet spares, 
What follows it, must come to pass. 
What fresh and vital forces, canst thou guess, 
What from the world have I to gain? 
What happened? 
What he never comprehends, 
What helps one's beauty, youthful blood? 
What hidden crime? 
What hidden sense in this enigma lies? 
What hinders me from smiting now 
     What is that here? 
What is that? God in Heaven! Whence came 
What is thy name? 
What is unspeakable! 
What is your business? I would fain-- 
What mean you? Wait!--you'll pay for't dearly! 
What means the gentleman? 
What means the sieve? 
What murmurest thou? 
What must be, let it quickly be! 
What need to shorten so the way? 
What need to talk of Inspiration? 
What need, that after words thou yearnest? 
What no man ever saw, I'll give to thee. 
What nonsense she declaims before us! 
What once you did at a single blow, 
What place of martyrdom is here! 
What rises up from the threshold here? 
What says the sage, now first I recognize: 
What seek I? Why so full my heart, and sore? 
What shall therewith be done? 
What sweetest thrill is in my blood! 
What they're accustomed to, is no great matter, 
What time takes she for dissipating? 
What use, a Whole compactly to present? 
What use, in having that to play with? 
     What want you thus? 
What weave they there round the raven-stone? 
What will you bet? There's still a chance to gain him, 
What wilt from me, Base Spirit, say?-- 
        What woe, what woe and sorrow 
What work I do,--how hard and steady is it! 
What would I not, to give thee pleasure? 
What wouldst thou, then? She thinks that thou art flown; 
What you the Spirit of the Ages call 
What! I delay to free her? 
What! Not a pocket-piece? no jewelry? 
What! shall the Poet that which Nature gave, 
What! whirled so far astray? 
What's done has happed--what haps, is done! 
What's done's already done, alas! 
What's foreign one can't always keep quite clear of, 
What's genuine, shall Posterity inherit. 
What's going on? 
What's left undone to-day, To-morrow will not do. 
                          What's that to thee? 
What, Sir! you dare to make so free, 
What, in the twilight, can your mind so trouble? 
When I am present she's impressed, she knows not how; 
When I have sat at some carouse. 
When I the starry courses know, 
When I upon the Blocksberg meet you, 
When Shame is born and first appears, 
When _There_ again we come together, 
When all the honest folk will turn 
        When came his time of dying, 
When down in Turkey, far away, 
When foes in combat sorely press you; 
When foolish fasts and prayers my life tormented. 
When from the hard-won goal the wreath 
When he is by, I could not pray to Heaven. 
When lovely maids, in fond desire, 
When o'er our heads, lost in the vaulted azure, 
When on an idler's bed I stretch myself in quiet. 
When on the spindle, spun to endless distance, 
        When once 'tis done 
When once inside the door comes he, 
When one of us at spinning sat, 
When others dance, he weighs the matter: 
When over crags and piny highlands 
When peace we crave and more luxurious diet. 
     When round the summit whirls our flight, 
When she succeeds therewith a youth to snare, 
When some poor maiden was beguiled! 
When such a head as thine no outlet knows, 
When the strife's compounded. 
When the vault echoes to the song, 
When they but look thee in the face:-- 
When thou from honor didst depart 
When thou hast dashed this world to pieces, 
When thou, still innocent, 
When thus I hail the Moment flying: 
When to our booth the current sets apace, 
     When towards the Devil's House we tread, 
When was a human soul, in its supreme endeavor, 
When we were all-in-all, then, truly, 
When you have learned, all things reducing, 
When, after dancing out your breath, 
When, in the spirit of the ages planted, 
When, like a fount, the crowding measures 
When, piece by piece, can one the things abroad display, 
Whence all the world is cheered and edified. 
Whence o'er the heart his empire free? 
Whence one seeth, with amaze, 
Whence the glad tidings hither float; 
Whence, ever retreating, he sends again 
Whence, willingly, the comrade him I gave, 
Where God His human creature set, 
Where I and Martha wait thy coming. 
Where Love and Friendship still divinely fashion 
Where a thousand threads one treadle throws, 
Where am I? What a lovely land! 
Where art thou? 
Where art thou, Faust, whose voice has pierced to me, 
Where boon companions meet together, 
Where canst thou horns and tail and claws discover? 
Where each to each his brag allows, 
Where even the welcome daylight strains 
Where first I looked on thee; 
Where fly the shuttles hither and thither. 
Where four roads cross, in wanton play to meet her: 
Where hast thou servant, coach and horses? 
Where is he? I heard him call me. 
Where is he? If I catch the scoundrel hiding, 
Where is our couple now? 
Where is the breast, which from itself a world did bear, 
Where it may throb in grandest consonance? 
Where once a heaven thy glances did create me, 
Where tends thy thought? 
Where they have entered in, there also they withdraw. 
Where we originated; 
Where would you get contemporary fun? 
Where ye for men twist shredded thought like paper, 
Where you, ye beasts? Founts of all Being, shining, 
        Where'er I go, what sorrow, 
Where'er you touch, there's interest without end. 
Where, how, and when he died, to certify his fitness. 
     Where, in seclusion, 
Whereby for eighty years thy youth thou keepest! 
Whereby one rises to the source! 
Whereby the nature usually is expressed. 
Wherefore forsakest thou the lovely maiden, 
Wherefore the hag, and her alone? 
Wherefore, from Magic I seek assistance, 
Wherefrom the fountain flings eternal spray, 
Wherefrom, sometimes, I wet my throttle, 
Wherein the Ages are reflected. 
Wherein, Sirs, can I be of use? 
Whereon hang Heaven's and Earth's desire, 
Whereto our withered hearts aspire,-- 
Whereto yearns every sense within me? 
Wherewith the mind itself deludes! 
Whether you everywhere be trying, 
Which Jew and King may also claim. 
Which Nature portions out so lovingly-- 
Which always wills the Bad, and always works the Good. 
Which binds the world, and guides its course; 
Which brings me near and nearer to the Gods, 
Which chaste hearts, notwithstanding, cannot spare; 
Which digs with eager hand for buried ore, 
Which elsewhere I have just been earning. 
Which every valley richly bore me! 
     Which had a-----------------; 
Which has not, once, sore hurt inflicted 
Which he, approaching, round us seems to wind? 
Which leads thee with its motherly control, 
Which nowhere worthier is, more nobly sent, 
Which there, behind, I glimmering see? 
Which threatened soon to overwhelm my senses: 
Which through the firmament diffused is faring, 
Which through the holy spheres of Nature groped and wandered, 
Which to the vaulted ceiling creep, 
Which way com'st thou hither? 
Which, also, not the slightest, stinks; 
Which, then? 
Which, through the night of Death, the angels ministrant 
While Man's desires and aspirations stir, 
While all about lie pastures fresh and green. 
While over the river, that broadly dallies, 
While we to warm our paws are waiting. 
While yet in joyous growth I sang,-- 
While, thus to do, for years another pleads. 
     Whirl of their dancing! 
Whisks and whirls in measure: 
(_Whispering_) 
Who? 
Who are the strangers, should you guess? 
     Who are you here? 
Who art thou, then? 
Who bade them so construe it? 
Who bids the storm to passion stir the bosom? 
Who braids the noteless leaves to crowns, requiting 
Who brings the One to join the general ordination, 
Who calls from the rocky cleft below there? 
Who calls me? 
     Who cannot raise himself to-night 
Who comes to you with courage good, 
Who dare express Him? 
Who dares the child's true name in public mention? 
     Who eaten me hath! 
Who every flower for himself would take, 
Who genially his nature can outpour, 
Who give me attendance. 
     Who had a big black flea, 
Who had a big black flea-- 
Who has done me this ill? 
Who heretofore, in evil days, 
Who knows not their sense 
Who knows, now, whither the four winds have blown it? 
Who lies here? 
Who makes Olympus sure, the Gods uniting? 
Who offers much, brings something unto many, 
Who overcometh, winneth too. 
     Who put me to death; 
Who scatters every fairest April blossom 
     Who sneaks to us? 
            Who stood, the dance surveying: 
     Who takes no thought, 
Who teaches help, and succor sends! 
Who towards me pressed with all thine energy? 
Who traps the Devil, hold him fast! 
Who was that gentleman, to-day. 
Who works, excites, and must create, as Devil. 
Who would himself therefrom deliver? 
Who wouldn't lose his heart, that met you? 
Who'd think of that in love's selected season? 
Who'll also add his deposition. 
Who'll help me to my footing? 
Who's there? 
Who, feeling, seeing, 
Who, headsman! unto thee such power 
Who, in his dusky work-shop bending, 
Who, now, a work of moderate sense will read? 
Who, scorning all external gleams, 
Who, then, the changeless orders of creation 
Whoever could have brought me things so precious? 
Whom but to see, puts out the fire of Song! 
     Whom fat and butter made smoother: 
Whom men to me with reverence name. 
Whom then? 
Whom wilt thou lure? God's-element! 
Whom, after rapid, maddening dances, 
Whose over-hasty impulse drave him 
Whose wicked clench is all in vain! 
Why at the threshold wilt snuffing be? 
Why do ye stir the porridge so? 
Why do you go that way? 
Why does he come, then, to our ball? 
Why heat thyself, thus instantly, 
Why here to caverns, rocky hollows slinking, 
Why howl, you women there? Instead, 
Why is my heart so anxious, on thy breast? 
        Why it trembleth, why it yearneth, 
Why must the stream so soon run dry and fail us, 
                 Why not? 'tis light. 
Why plague thyself with threshing straw forever? 
Why should I fly? They'll still my steps waylay! 
Why should you rack, poor, foolish bards, 
Why so fast and so fell? 
Why so? What has it done to thee? 
Why some inexplicable smart 
Why stand you thus, with such astonished eyes? 
Why such a noise? What are my lord's commands? 
Why suck'st, from sodden moss and dripping stone, 
        Why this anxious heart so burneth, 
Why thou shouldst ask, I don't perceive. 
Why waste so vainly thy resplendence? 
Why! If the fount of wine should still be playing? 
Why, 'twas a real ecstasy! 
Why, Zounds! Both hands and feet are, truly-- 
Why, all at once, exhaust the joyance? 
Why, be one then, outright! 
Why, for a poodle who has lost his master, 
Why, here in dust, entice me with your spell, 
Why, just such talk as this, for me, 
Why, let them break their heads, let loose their passions, 
Why, on the whole, thou'rt--what thou art. 
Why, surely, if a God first plagues Himself six days, 
Why, tell me now, thou Son of Hades, 
Why, then will I myself, I vow, 
Why, therefore, yield to such depression? 
Why, wipe it off! Methinks that yet 
Will after noon return again. 
Will as a servant wait behind thee. 
Will as servant, slave, with thee abide. 
Will best, on Sundays, fondle and caress. 
Will finally, himself, his bit select: 
Will have it, certainly. 
Will make a brilliant demonstration. 
Will serve thee at once and forever 
Will that, too, prompt this heart of thine? 
Will the dog, like man, snarl _his_ displeasure? 
Will willingly walk beside thee,-- 
Wilt thou grasp the thunder? Well that it has not been given to you, 
Wilt thou, to introduce us to the revel, 
     Wine, that is dashing 
(_With a gesture_:) 
With a good mouthful I must be supplied. 
With all its bays, in shining sleep! 
With all my heart! Now, here's a bottle, 
With all that I have undertaken, 
With all thy likeness to God, thou'lt yet be a sorry example! 
With all you gentlemen, the name's a test, 
With all your tripping vagrance. 
        With anguish smarting, 
With any--only satisfy our need. 
With arts of mine afford thee recreation. 
With best endeavor, 
With brazen forehead, daring breast? 
With breast to breast, and soul to soul united? 
With brimming glass that spilled the toast, 
With calm across my tumult stealing, 
     With clearer sense, 
     With crystalline spaces, 
With dazzling cheats and dear devices 
With eloquence exaggerated? 
With even devils consorting. 
With every hope of future pleasure, 
With fairest images of dreams infold him, 
With fiery eyes, teeth terrible to see: 
With fire on fire your throbbing forehead crowning, 
With glasses, boxes, round me stacked, 
With grinning masks of life prevent 
With hair all bristling, it begins to swell. 
With heavenly manna she'll repay it!" 
        With his knights of high degree, 
With holy fire I'll scorch and sting thee! 
With honest purpose, once for all, 
With impulse, mystic and divine, 
With labor whimsical, and pain: 
With light of power my soul shall glow, 
With little art, clear wit and sense 
With little wit, and ease to suit them, 
With lofty speech, though by them scorned and spurned: 
With magic works and shows that blind thee, 
With maxims most pragmatical and hitting, 
With milk and water: 'twas my own. 
With most foreboding presence? 
With much delight I see the play, 
With new impulsion 
With one begin'st thou secretly, 
With open throat sing chorus, drink and roar! 
With paragraphs all got by heart, 
With power to feel and to enjoy it. Thou 
     With powerful fist: 
With proved adepts in company, 
With resolute, courageous trust 
With several wild young blades, a soldier-lover: 
With sharpest nippers flitting, 
With sneers and stinging taunts disgrace me, 
          With spices and precious 
With spirits through mountain-caverns hover, 
With struggling, chilling, checking, so deprave him 
With such a servant danger comes, I fear. 
With such advantages endow! 
     With sweat and with blood 
With tears, wrung hands and sighs, I've striven, 
With terrible wrath 
With thanks and health to all and each. 
With the police 'twere easy to compound it, 
With this fair girl will not succeed; 
With turned-up nose each scamp may face me, 
With unmixed food thy body nourish; 
With what a feeling, thou great man, must thou 
With what a pang one leaves so many a spot, 
With what a vintage can I serve you? 
With what delight, what profit winning, 
With what fierce blows upon my neck 'tis beating! 
With wilful cavil would diminish, 
With wings that winnow blessing 
     With witchhood's swarms of wantonness! 
With words 'tis excellent disputing; 
With youth and revel round you like a zone: 
Withdrawn to the mountains, a crownless king: 
Within a grave well consecrated, 
Within a narrow sphere to flourish; 
Within her cabin on the Alpine field 
        Within my bosom aches! 
Within my breast he fans a lawless fire, 
Within my deepest, inmost soul I hate. 
        Within my lonely chamber 
Within my press! Of ebony,-- 
Within the Lily's tepid bath espoused, 
Within those bushes; I've a mind to see. 
Within thy bosom 
     Within whose dread and holy keeping 
Without a salary their parts performing. 
Without or gold or magic or physician. 
Without return to be enjoying. 
Without that, I have appetite. 
Woe! 
Woe for my garland! The chances 
Woe to thee! 
  Woe! I endure not thee! 
     Woe! woe! 
Woe! woe! 
Woe! woe! They come. O death of bitterness! 
Woe's me! I fear to lose my wits. 
Woe's me, canst thou naught better find! 
Woe's me, the fearful bellow! 
          Woes that molested him, 
     Woman in thousand steps is theft. 
     Woman's a thousand steps ahead. 
Woman, from such a name refrain! 
Worse than the pestilence, have passed. 
Would I were forth! 
Would I were free from the thoughts 
Would e'er these people scent the Devil! 
Would he still lay among the grass he grows in! 
Would mother came!--where can she bide? 
Would of my wrong to her I might be shriven!" 
Would pain me in its wonted fashion. 
Would that I had some influence! 
Would then no more impede my godlike motion; 
Would there were other work for thee! 
Wrath takes thee!

YOUNG WITCH 
Ye angels, holy cohorts, guard me, 
Ye choirs, have ye begun the sweet, consoling chant, 
Ye crowd more near! Then, be the reign assigned ye, 
Ye flow, ye feed: and am I vainly pining? 
Ye gentle, powerful sounds of Heaven? 
Ye gentlemen, don't pass me thus! 
Ye, Spirits, come--ye hover near-- 
Yea, if a magic mantle once were mine, 
Yes, I am Faust: I am thy peer! 
Yes, Neighbor! that's my notion, too: 
Yes, Sir, 'tis late. 
Yes, child! and let this blossom-word 
Yes, for our household small has grown, 
Yes, for the pious, I suspect, 
Yes, gracious Sir, in all obedience! 
Yes, he deserves your favor thoroughly,-- 
Yes, knew I not more deeply thy desire. 
Yes, my good dame, a pair of witnesses 
Yes, of the kind which men attain! 
Yes, one of weight, with many sighs: 
Yes, out of sight is out of mind! 
Yes, sing away, sing on, and praise, and brag of her! 
Yes, the mountain's side along, 
Yes, the poor women are bad off, 'tis true: 
Yes, thou findest that unpleasant! 
Yes, when the priest comedian is by nature, 
Yes, your discourses, with their glittering show, 
Yet I betimes myself prepare 
Yet I perceive no cloven foot; 
Yet I would take again, and willing, all the worry, 
Yet all that I indulge in newly, 
Yet also we must have a ruling head, I hope, 
Yet always doesn't the thing succeed. 
Yet am I near, and love keeps watch and ward; 
Yet choose thyself a faculty! 
Yet drinks their wines with hearty cheer. 
Yet he allures the fair ones. 
Yet he who grasps the Moment's gift, 
Yet here a huge embarrassment I feel: 
Yet in each soul is born the pleasure 
Yet in the ranks, at once, we're here 
Yet in the word must some idea be. 
Yet in thy writing as unwearied be, 
Yet is not grown a whit the fairer. 
Yet must I trouble you again. 
Yet must be cared for, you will own. 
Yet my delight 'twill also be! 
Yet now I curse whate'er entices 
"Yet she, God knows! was more to blame than I." 
Yet something from a tour I always save, 
Yet something is required from us. 
Yet strict attention must be given. 
Yet this delusion in our hearts we bear: 
Yet thou canst often this way wander, 
Yet through delivery orators succeed; 
Yet we're eternally sterile still. 
Yet will I know it. 
Yet with the flowing beard I wear, 
Yet, Lord, Thy messengers are praising 
Yet, as I write, a warning is suggested, 
Yet, finally, the weary god is sinking; 
Yet, for the threshold's magic which controlled him, 
Yet, hast thou food which never satiates, now,-- 
Yet, if this man without due preparation drinks, 
Yet, on my word, his cash was put to proper uses. 
Yet, pray, don't take it as annoyance! 
Yet, therefore, no whit better men we see: 
Yet, though I thresh them all together, 
Yet, truly, I've some inclination 
Yet, wilt thou to me entrust 
Yet, young and tender though you be, 
     Yet,-----as 'twas, I fancied it. 
Yet--all that drove my heart thereto, 
Yon sun beholds my sorrows in his courses; 
Yonder afar, from the hill-paths blinking, 
Yonder, with special light, there's something shining clearer 
Yonder, within the landlord's box of tools, there's one! 
You almost like a Frenchman prate; 
You are not miserly, I trust? 
You are so kind, compassionate. 
You are the master of the house, I mark, 
You clasp the swelling hips, to see 
You cook the scraps from others' fare; 
You do not feel, how such a trade debases; 
You each, at home, are quite enough alone. 
You face it out, impertinent and heady? 
You have it now! he understands. 
You know the quality that can 
You meet by accident; you feel, you stay, 
You mustn't take things too precisely. 
You mustn't tell it to your mother! 
You now oppose the fist infernal, 
You pass the night in dissipating:-- 
You press and count the pulse's dances, 
You rail, and it is fun to me. 
You see a man, as others be. 
You sit forever gluing, patching; 
You still are here? Nay, 'tis a thing unheard! 
You swaggering fellow, is your hide 
You two, who oft a helping hand 
You wanted them: I've given you mine. 
You well deserve a speedy marriage-offer: 
You'll always have them at your feet. 
You'll find it of peculiar operation. 
You'll have him, when and where you wander: 
You'll know us, to your detriment. 
You'll let me triumph with a swelling breast: 
You'll ne'er attain it, save you know the feeling, 
You'll never mount the airy steep 
You'll then work on, because you must. 
You're pleased, forsooth, full houses to behold? 
You're ravished quite, then comes a touch of woe, 
You've a visitor of high degree. 
You've but to lunge, and I will parry. 
You've made me roundly sweat, that's certain! 
You've not the casks already at the door? 
You've verily hit the truth! Leipzig to me is dear: 
Your bliss is by no means so great 
Your cane, if in the stream you fling it. 
Your company shall give us pleasure. 
Your courtesy an easy grace is; 
Your courtesy doth flatter me: 
Your hearers pick and pluck, as soon as they receive it! 
Your husband's dead, and sends a greeting. 
Your lungs, till breath and being fail you: 
Your messages I hear, but faith has not been given; 
Your mind will shortly be set aright, 
Yourself, perhaps, would keep the bubble? 
Youth always has the upper hand. 
Youth, good my friend, you certainly require

THE STUDY 
THE STUDY

_Ah, tara, lara da_! 
        In the Castle by the Sea. 
Who had a big black flea-- 
     Who had a big black flea, 
        And sinking deep in the sea: 
  An eternal sea, 
From sea to land, from land to sea. 
Dame Martha! 
            Hurrah--tarara-la! 
            Hurrah--tarara-la! 
            Hurrah--tarara-la! 
            Hurrah--tarara-la! 
        _Diesira, dies illa, 
        Solvet soeclum in favilla_! 
Hast nothing heard of Barbara? 
Cometh Puck, and, light of limb, 
It was a blow that went through every limb! 
        Out of Corruption's womb: 
And all the swaggerers were dumb. 
Be still, old wine-tub. 
Now, what shall come of this? the creatures antic, 
The crazy stuff, the gestures frantic,-- 
I must be idiotic! 
Is really too despotic: 
(_who up to this time have been making all kinds of fantastic 
That love, to him, is a thing abhorréd. 
My little sister's dead. 
Thy sense is shut, thy heart is dead: 
In smoke and mould the fleshless dead 
FAUST (_with averted head_) 
        My poor weak head 
[Illustration: _Roll the devilish eyes wrathfully in thy head_] 
As if a mill-wheel whirled in my head! 
          "Now, you I call a stupid-head!" 
Turn off this spirit from his fountain-head; 
(_Pours a glass of wine over_ BRANDER'S _head_.) 
And the others are now so far ahead! 
     Woman's a thousand steps ahead. 
I, image of the Godhead! 
'Tis written on his very forehead 
Cloud and trailing mist o'erhead 
The ranks of living creatures thou dost lead 
"In the Beginning was the _Power,"_ I read. 
She in my mask a hidden sense would read: 
Who, now, a work of moderate sense will read? 
'Twas sure an old Greek tragedy you read? 
     When towards the Devil's House we tread, 
Since now it stands one in good stead. 
Alas! in living Nature's stead, 
So long I stumble, ill bestead, 
Why howl, you women there? Instead, 
He takes these gaudy people instead. 
     And soon enough the poor beast had, 
          Around the linden lass and lad 
          Already footed it like mad: 
     He whirled and jumped, with torment mad, 
love-mad. 
The Blocksberg has a summit broad, 
Spider's foot and paunch of toad, 
Now she is lively, mostly sad, 
(_He throws himself into a leathern arm-chair near the bed_.) 
     Were plagued, awake and in bed; 
        Already on my bed. 
As if in Spanish boots 'twere laced, 
Some baubles I therein had placed, 
To the left, where the plank is placed 
There will your mind be drilled and braced, 
No test or trial you evaded: 
It seems the business has succeeded. 
And so, but little time is needed, 
The poodle naught remarked, as after thee he speeded; 
By bodies is its course impeded; 
A Helping God the helper aided. 
I've almost for Theology decided. 
I should not wish to see you here misguided: 
To be our peer, with us, the Spirits, banded? 
And thus, my own sole self to all their selves expanded, 
And shaped and cherished--which with joy expanded, 
I too, at last, shall with them all be stranded! 
The world's, as well, must soon be ended. 
So that he felt it till his days were ended. 
This was the medicine--the patients' woes soon ended, 
          Gloriously ended! 
Now for the last time I've the witches'-hill ascended: 
          Christ is ascended! 
The lofty works, uncomprehended, 
Though still by them uncomprehended, 
As he in Naples wandered round, unfriended; 
Our converse here must be suspended. 
That so our learned talk might be extended. 
Might I again presume, with trust unbounded, 
When the strife's compounded. 
To hear your wisdom thoroughly expounded? 
Must fifty years be rounded: 
Yet always doesn't the thing succeed. 
Yet through delivery orators succeed; 
With this fair girl will not succeed; 
I feel that I am far behind, indeed. 
And the damned throw of dice, indeed. 
So innocent is she, indeed, 
And not for death, indeed. 
And as regards the younger folk, indeed, 
Perhaps the very Devil, indeed! 
That were to venture far, indeed. 
Is it the _Thought_ which works, creates, indeed? 
Now that thou art a whore indeed, 
So this advice I bid thee heed-- 
Most Worthy Pedagogue, take heed! 
And treated _your_ slips with as little heed. 
But fifteen minutes' time is all I need; 
That to confess she had no need. 
Do I not always share her need? 
With any--only satisfy our need. 
Speak out, and make your choice with speed! 
For our fine trip, meanwhile, prepare thyself with speed! 
The wild stag's speed, 
I tell you, once for all, that speed 
Air in leaves, and wind in reed, 
The courage of the lion's breed, 
She is judged! 
(_After the holes have been bored and plugged_) 
The lamp's extinguished!-- 
Whence all the world is cheered and edified. 
And, if thou art satisfied, 
If thou therewith art fully satisfied, 
With a good mouthful I must be supplied. 
Thus the best beverage is supplied, 
Well-made you are, 'tis not to be denied, 
Health to the man, so skilled and tried. 
A third time itching to be tried? 
Don't swarm so round the Naked! 
Ancestral lumber, stuffed and packed-- 
With glasses, boxes, round me stacked, 
True, with the child a troubled life I led, 
And him, with thee, be downward led; 
Her little world therein concealed. 
The might of Man, as in the Bard revealed. 
What do I see? What heavenly form revealed 
Good! the method is revealed 
     The maids were bitten and bled. 
Bliss grows apace, and then its course is jangled; 
And by degrees your heart is tangled; 
When some poor maiden was beguiled! 
But soon to seek them is beguiled. 
How scornfully I once reviled, 
As Orpheus' lyre the brutes compelled, 
On fire each mountain-peak, with peace each valley filled, 
My steps by one slight obstacle controlled,-- 
     Things are badly controlled, 
Eternal, swift, are onward whirled! 
By Nature's listless hand the thread is twirled, 
In sullen jangle are together hurled, 
And instruments together hurled, 
Against the rocks' deep bases hurled, 
     In ruin 'tis hurled, 
Before him I should blush, ashamed. 
Before no king that could be named! 
In truth, 'tis well and fitly timed, 
FAUST (_overwhelmed_) 
Now again requickened, 
What happened? 
And how the Devil jests, be now enlightened! 
Was that your nose I tightened? 
Behind the stove still banned, 
Sways like a harp-string by the breezes fanned. 
Howe'er for them one may have worked and planned? 
And the stern heart is tenderly unmanned. 
In Hell itself, then, laws are reckoned? 
The God, above my powers enthroned, 
The few, who thereof something really learned, 
If Thou hadst not all merriment unlearned. 
Have evermore been crucified and burned. 
With lofty speech, though by them scorned and spurned: 
The God that in my breast is owned 
And, lacking blossoms, blue, yellow, and red, 
        The morning sun shone red: 
To bathe thy breast in morning-red!" 
How she stared and glared! 
Here winds away, and in a hundred 
He lied! What! On the brink of death he slandered? 
Which through the holy spheres of Nature groped and wandered, 
In the last throes his senses wandered, 
And honestly, in his own fashion, pondered 
There, in a corner pressed and sundered, 
     The scattered 
If still they live, wide through the world are scattered. 
Frightened, the owlets are scattered: 
     By the blow of a demigod shattered! 
Hearken! the pillars are shattered. 
And those beside, whose joy my Song so flattered, 
I am seized, and bound, and delivered-- 
Now over each neck has quivered 
To clear the folly out, how have I swept and stirred! 
He'll be of spirits and of Spirit cured. 
The solace this, whereof he's most assured: 
He calls it Reason--thence his power's increased, 
Already there, with curious eyebrows raised, 
No hand with loving pressure closed; 
The body sweet, beside which I reposed! 
How, in crowds together massed, 
Worse than the pestilence, have passed. 
If the mountain we had only passed! 
Its perfect stature stands at last confessed! 
          All for the dance the shepherd dressed, 
The Words of the Four be addressed: 
A garter that her knee has pressed! 
By all things saddened and oppressed; 
So, by the burden of my days oppressed, 
A heaven thy loving words expressed, 
Whereby the nature usually is expressed. 
Thy wish be on Walpurgis Night expressed; 
The timid lips have stammeringly expressed,-- 
By turns in either bridal chamber housed. 
Within the Lily's tepid bath espoused, 
The dog, when he's well educated, 
Could such a spirit be so cheated? 
Am I again so foully cheated? 
And all of life for all mankind created 
Must something clever be created. 
'Twere better, then, were naught created. 
For cool, eternal rest created. 
I wish the crowd to feel itself well treated, 
Irregular ways I've always hated; 
Can Earth with such a thing be mated? 
Learn how we were mated! 
My powers I have not rashly estimated: 
Where we originated; 
Are now illuminated: 
For in the rat by poison bloated 
And all is dissipated. 
Thus, all which you as Sin have rated,-- 
Consider well: my memory good is rated. 
As glittering gallants rated. 
First be separated! 
Within a grave well consecrated, 
With eloquence exaggerated? 
Is by the wisest tolerated. 
My bosom, of its thirst for knowledge sated, 
The terms with graver, quill, or chisel, stated? 
I want his death in the weekly paper stated. 
Me hast thou long with might attracted, 
Long from my sphere thy food exacted, 
Has not your heart been anywhere subjected? 
Wherein the Ages are reflected. 
(_The caldron, which the_ SHE-APE _has up to this time neglected 
And yet, there's nothing I've collected-- 
Speak plainly, Sir, have you no one detected? 
Are now a book with seven seals protected: 
Which has not, once, sore hurt inflicted 
The posts are set, the booth of boards completed. 
Inspect the thing: the drawing's not completed. 
Has not Sir Mammon grandly lighted 
     Tendrils unblighted! 
Show yourselves, delighted! 
Thy palate then with taste delighted, 
And, if it last, wilt soon be plighted 
     Lovers are plighted, 
A quiet hour, to see us fondly plighted, 
They are newly plighted. 
Already art thou o'er-excited, 
But that a dream the Devil counterfeited, 
With breast to breast, and soul to soul united? 
The boisterous guests approach that were invited. 
Thy scent will be to bliss invited; 
        Now sits exalted? 
        Burst from the vaulted 
     In the sphere of dreams enchanted. 
To trap him, let thy snares be planted, 
     That our feet be forwards planted 
When, in the spirit of the ages planted, 
Here a middle-peak is planted, 
Enough! What thou hast asked is granted. 
Pardon! a great delight is granted 
Another baffled hope must be lamented: 
When foolish fasts and prayers my life tormented. 
Here from our wandering will we rest contented. 
Not any potent balsam yet invented? 
The pack of devils by no rules is daunted: 
Grasp my skirt with heart undaunted! 
We are so wise, and yet is Tegel haunted. 
How men torment themselves, is all I've noted. 
The bald-pate pot-belly I have noted: 
Of suns and worlds I've nothing to be quoted; 
     Tranquiller-hearted 
At our last interview, before we parted 
     Clouds had departed! 
No doubt 'twas late when you from Rippach started? 
Yet, as I write, a warning is suggested, 
No man the ancient leaven has digested! 
Shall not, henceforth, from any pang be wrested, 
The same tough meat have chewed and tested, 
Shall be within mine inmost being tested: 
That I the sense may not have fairly tested. 
     To entrap us, unresisted: 
     And the roots, like serpents twisted, 
From generation unto generation fitted, 
Let Fancy be with her attendants fitted,-- 
But have a care, lest Folly be omitted! 
All rights and laws are still transmitted 
And I am saved!-- 
         She is saved! 
his belly in the dust before me,--that I may trample him, the outlawed, 
But if you forwards go, his ire is most displayed. 
Called forth, deserve to be destroyed: 
     Thou hast it destroyed, 
        My senses mazed. 
They sit sedate, and hope to be amazed. 
        Is racked and crazed; 
The ladies with themselves, and with their finery, aid, 
Alas! the wings that lift the mind no aid 
          And with his elbow punched a maid, 
        Lets in a maid. 
        That out a maid 
The God, who fashioned youth and maid, 
          He broke the ranks, no whit afraid, 
          The buxom wench, she turned and said: 
I feel as stupid, from all you've said, 
I'm dying! That is quickly said, 
And what we should not, often did; 
And all Thy works, sublime and splendid, 
The angels from his visage splendid 
If then appeared, with colors splendid, 
We've but to make a deposition valid 
That now her husband's limbs, outstretched and pallid, 
But now all things have from their bases slid, 
And justly so: for all things, from the Void 
The rabble by such hate are held, 
Within her cabin on the Alpine field 
Betake thyself to yonder field, 
And bear me to her beauteous field! 
Desert with fame, in Action's every field? 
Then would I see eternal Evening gild 
So from its mother's breasts a child 
Save thy perishing child! 
My tears gush forth: the Earth takes back her child! 
Sound on, ye hymns of Heaven, so sweet and mild! 
A witches'-guild. 
And when your hands unroll some parchment rare and old, 
And richer far than were the old. 
No rest to-night for young or old! 
(_who all at once appears very old_) 
Come, follow me! My darling, be more bold: 
And he wouldn't, else, have been so bold! 
The half are coarse, the half are cold. 
I'll clasp thee, soon, with warmth a thousand-fold; 
Creative Nature to my soul unfold. 
The deep, mysterious miracles unfold. 
        Except the goblet of gold. 
Then, too, I've neither lands nor gold, 
Like sister Margaret, good as gold,-- 
     And had I but gold, 
They start another dance: come now, let us take hold! 
One that to her can a candle hold?" 
Nor the world's least pomp or honor hold-- 
In these pure features I behold 
And much could I in his face behold,-- 
And things, all splendid to behold, 
You're pleased, forsooth, full houses to behold? 
A chimney, also, you behold. 
        The towns in his land he told, 
Then winter nights take loveliness untold, 
Such is my world: and what a world! 
     The beautiful world, 
(_bores: in the meantime one has made the wax stoppers, and 
rise from the caldron. An ape sits beside it, skims it, and 
misery of this single one pierces to the very marrow of my life; and 
Seest thou the black dog coursing there, through corn and 
For that serene and solemn Spirit-Land: 
Loose, Error, from their eyes the band, 
Perchance my love, amid the childish band, 
Here meekly kissed the grandsire's withered hand. 
You two, who oft a helping hand 
Saved by your father's skillful hand, 
And yours that still I have in hand? 
And when the clock strikes, be on hand! 
(_He kisses her hand_.) 
Youth always has the upper hand. 
        In the clasp of his hand, 
(_reversing the brush, which he has been holding in his hand, 
And purple grapes at hand! 
Smiling, the bumper in my hand: 
From Nostradamus' very hand, 
This racking fuss on every hand, 
Back into quiet settle sea and land! 
Fly! Up, and seek the broad, free land! 
But is there one in all the land 
And stayed the plague in all the land. 
Of this, our enterprise, in German land! 
Where am I? What a lovely land! 
See it, an elephant, expand! 
From earthquake, tempest, wave, volcano's brand, 
Thou gav'st me Nature as a kingdom grand, 
But would that I, on mountains grand, 
Like scattered showers of golden sand;-- 
And, for the first time, here I stand 
Amid thy blessed light could stand, 
The rocky ramparts blazing stand. 
Ah, you don't understand! 
Five hours a day, you understand, 
There let, at once, my record end! 
Look yonder! thou canst scarcely see the end: 
The best thou learnest, in the end 
Where'er you touch, there's interest without end. 
O'er books and papers saw me bend; 
Each shares therein, though few may comprehend: 
That is no little space: what say'st thou, friend? 
I gaze, as in the bosom of a friend. 
Ever thine eye, most mournful friend, 
A friend! 
But still the time may reach us, good my friend. 
_District of Schierke and Elend_. 
Let Neighbor Paunch to that attend! 
He snares our feet, some future chain to bind. 
My neighbor's one of them, I find, 
Naught so insipid in the world I find 
Since, in his master's stead, two strangers doth he find. 
And sensibler than I, you'll find. 
A splendid word to serve, you'll find 
No shop, on earth, like this you'll find!-- 
And scents about, his track to find. 
Woe's me, canst thou naught better find! 
Not quite so fast! Two others come behind,-- 
The Day before me and the Night behind, 
(MARGARET _among much people: the_ EVIL SPIRIT _behind_ 
But I am sure--that you are very kind. 
Upon the world, and on mankind. 
MARTHA (_peeping through the blind_) 
I'm sorry I'm so blind: 
Has Nature, then, and has a noble mind 
Yes, out of sight is out of mind! 
For what goes in--or won't go in--your mind. 
Hail him, who keeps a steadfast mind! 
The new-born impulse fires my mind,-- 
Which he, approaching, round us seems to wind? 
The first is free to us; we're governed by the second. 
'Tis for your sweetheart's room you're bound, 
And truly, song must here rebound 
"In her the flower o' the sex is found!" 
Go on! It is a woe profound! 
The awful Night's intense profound: 
The splendor of the world goes round, 
'Mid brother-spheres, his ancient round: 
FAUST (_looking around_) 
pieces, with which they spring around_.) 
Cling! clang! "Here's to her!" went around 
If I am right, we heard the sound 
He ends with step of thunder-sound. 
Call it Bliss! Heart! Love! God! 
O God! 
Believest thou in God? 
Which always wills the Bad, and always works the Good. 
But then one learns to relish rest and food. 
At first, reluctant, takes its food, 
One may possess them, well and good; 
Who comes to you with courage good, 
"My child," she said, "ill-gotten good 
Is for the wench a deal too good. 
     Little sister, so good, 
     O be thou so good 
Sir Baron call me thou, then is the matter good; 
     The wooden table gives wine as good! 
The Key of Solomon is good. 
Each leaf for such a pact is good; 
One's spirits, Sir, are thus not always good, 
The noble Sir should find it good, 
Such to encounter is not good: 
Half sport of childhood, 
A fellow made of genuine flesh and blood 
Upon thy threshold whose the blood? 
Ensnares the soul, consumes the blood. 
Thou hast no doubt about my noble blood: 
And to subscribe thy name thou'lt take a drop of blood. 
     With sweat and with blood 
What helps one's beauty, youthful blood? 
Their blank, set stare benumbs the human blood, 
And ever circulates a newer, fresher blood. 
Somewhat of cash, and healthy blood: 
The love of this young silly blood 
What sweetest thrill is in my blood! 
The Italian's fiery blood, 
For all of thy half-hellish brood 
And that damned stuff, the bestial, human brood,-- 
Part of that Power, not understood, 
     _Then was I a beautiful bird o' the wood; 
     Laid my bones in the wood, 
Into the wood, 
     The grapes are juicy, the vines are wood, 
In air and water and the silent wood. 
You still are here? Nay, 'tis a thing unheard! 
Twill ne'er be clean: why, 'tis a thing unheard! 
Each will the joy of the sunshine hoard, 
Yet am I near, and love keeps watch and ward; 
     Drink, and fly onward-- 
     Fly ever sunward 
(_The_ THREE ARCHANGELS _come forward_.)

VALENTINE (_comes forward_) 
I envy even the Body of the Lord 
It's really kind of such a noble Lord 
To honor the Day of the Risen Lord! 
'Tis written: "In the Beginning was the _Word_." 
Here am I balked: who, now can help afford? 
Vanish, at once! We've said the enlightening word. 
I like, at times, to hear The Ancient's word, 
Yes, child! and let this blossom-word 
The proper folks one's talents laud: 
The angel blossom from the bud.

FAUST (_aloud_) 
Though still confused his service unto Me, 
     Feel with polypus-antennae 
Yet in the word must some idea be. 
Yet in thy writing as unwearied be, 
By storm she cannot captured be; 
Let not the chance neglected be! 
But there enigmas also knotted be. 
Sir Microcosm his name should be. 
Among my equals I would be. 
How small the giant lout would be, 
In this game let our Lord God be! 
Well! I'll engage to let thee be: 
Why at the threshold wilt snuffing be? 
If your pairs would loving be, 
That's nothing! One must not so squeamish be; 
His partner in the dance you'll be,-- 
But might, the while, more useful be. 
One yet in growth will ever grateful be. 
That thou hast bored me, I must thankful be! 
No, Lord! I find things, there, still bad as they can be. 
That the wedding golden be. 
Meanwhile, may not the treasure risen be, 
Yet my delight 'twill also be! 
A traveller is so used to be 
I know what science this has come to be. 
Beware, a tinkling fool to be! 
Here I am Man,--dare man to be! 
My wedding-day it was to be! 
From Heaven they represent themselves to be, 
Unto each man his love she seems to be. 
Eavesdropping, ha! thy pleasure seems to be. 
A long-legged grasshopper appears to be, 
And, truly, it would easier be 
That I nor Chancellor nor Kaiser be. 
                Ah, shall there never be 
Though guessed the holy symbols be: 
You see a man, as others be. 
If tightly laced her corsets be. 
     And rich thou 'It be. 
That's well! So might a compact be 
     And two let be, 
If sacred or profane it be; 
'Tis truly wonderful! What can within it be? 
     'Tis done, let it be! 
If the diversion pleasant be. 
And to thine every nod obedient be: 
A little creature 'twill not be, 
And, truly! godless cannot be 
A canine form that cannot be! 
And yet, some hitch in't there must be 
Yet, young and tender though you be, 
Shall that a nosegay be? 
As haply now and then the case may be. 
See, what a delicate race they be! 
Can woman, then, so lovely be? 
What must be, let it quickly be! 
They took 't away, to vex me, maybe, 
When they but look thee in the face:-- 
No--look me, Sirs, straight in the face! 
I tell you, spirits, to your face, 
(_draws a stopper out of the table: fire flies in his face_.) 
Of God, the world and all that in it has a place, 
For me, I grant, sour wine is out of place; 
This bestial noise is out of place. 
"A gift-horse is not out of place, 
I give to spirit-despotism no place; 
And shifted round from place to place. 
I find it good: for that's your proper place. 
And claims of Mother Night her ancient place. 
Nor at the altar take thy place! 
But Margaret thought, with sour grimace, 
When to our booth the current sets apace, 
The haughty Light, which now disputes the space, 
Three years is but a little space. 
I need, at least, a fortnight's space, 
Like an eternal sickness of the race,-- 
Of Man, and all that moves the being of his race, 
And, God! who can the field embrace? 
The sacred tones that my soul embrace, 
Squeeze onward through the narrow gate of grace: 
Truly the fabric of mental fleece 
Resembles a weaver's masterpiece, 
     O cast thou the dice! 
Of flies and bed-bugs, frogs and lice, 
The lord of rats and eke of mice, 
     Make me rich in a trice, 
Give us a goblet of the well-known juice! 
Divides, and kindles into rhythmic dance? 
(_To_ FAUST, _who has left the dance_:) 
Plunge we in Time's tumultuous dance, 
Who give me attendance. 
Ho, there! my friend! I'll levy thine attendance: 
To Life it now renews the old allegiance. 
Have I concealed this countenance?-- 
Hear me not falsely, sweetest countenance! 
Where it may throb in grandest consonance? 
Lifts up, and makes a clearance! 
Nor care for the appearance. 
Through honey-dew and fragrance: 
With all your tripping vagrance. 
FAUST (_in the distance_) 
The way we take, our goal is yet some distance. 
When on the spindle, spun to endless distance, 
From an old hag shall I demand assistance? 
How hard it is to compass the assistance 
Wherefore, from Magic I seek assistance, 
DOST thou not wish a broomstick-steed's assistance? 
     Then Hope again lends sweet assistance, 
In the rush and roll of Circumstance! 
Why, all at once, exhaust the joyance? 
Yet, pray, don't take it as annoyance! 
Why waste so vainly thy resplendence? 
Is't life, I ask, is't even prudence, 
I cannot reconcile myself to Jurisprudence. 
Well said! and out with him that takes the least offence! 
I feel so small before others, and thence 
Yes, gracious Sir, in all obedience! 
FAUST (_after a moment's silence_) 
     Commence, 
The throats are tuned, commence! 
                 'Twill shortly recommence: 
Through flat and stale indifference; 
Hast for the scarlet coat no reverence? 
With most foreboding presence? 
And here was wrought, through holier, purer presence, 
Here lay the child, with Life's warm essence 
O no! with gentlemen of such pretence, 
First drives out the soul with rigid persistence; 
He who would study organic existence, 
     One yearns, the rivers of existence, 
So long as in my legs I feel the fresh existence. 
And the discordant tones of all existence 
Must the poor devil quit existence. 
No dog would endure such a curst existence! 
Full thirty years from my existence? 
Would that I had some influence! 
To head and heart, the force, 
No--let me go! I'll suffer no force! 
That I may detect the inmost force 
Whereby one rises to the source! 
The years a double strength produce. 
A glorious dream! though now the glories fade. 
        Beware! the blade 
He'd be a fool! A brisk young blade 
That in the greater world the little worlds are made. 
A fitter woman ne'er was made 
Then 'tis the same as were the step not made; 
Idly to us they come, as to a masquerade, 
It is an old, transmitted trade, 
Perceived the noblest purpose of His trade, 
Has room, elsewhere, to ply his trade. 
To ply the pimp and gypsy trade! 
Would mother came!--where can she bide? 
So let us by the farce abide. 
Will as servant, slave, with thee abide. 
That for our help he long may abide! 
For, if its quality I decide, 
If you but in yourself confide, 
You swaggering fellow, is your hide

Margaret! what's happened thee? 
That of senses and sap has betrayed thee, 
Come! or I'll leave her in the lurch, and thee! 
But one thing more! Beyond all risk to bind thee, 
Let but the Lying Spirit bind thee 
Will as a servant wait behind thee. 
With magic works and shows that blind thee, 
They would persuade thee. 
Among the beggars and cripples hide thee; 
Will willingly walk beside thee,-- 
But in some corner, woe betide thee! 
Thy steps through life, I'll guide thee,-- 
An angel, if like thee! 
Not even like thee! 
Let this warm clasp of hands declare thee 
Is parchment, then, the holy fount before thee, 
No true refreshment can restore thee, 
Set wigs of million curls upon thy head, to raise thee, 
Hear me exorcise thee! 
Now, to undisguise thee, 
Shuddering, refuse thee! 
I have thee! 
Thy cries will wake the guards, and they will seize thee! 
O, now am I sure of thee! 
I've done, else, all things for the love of thee. 
Leave me alone, I beg of thee! 
  Mark this, I beg of thee! 
But follow now! 'Tis all I beg of thee. 
Henry! I shudder to think of thee. 
A girl by the nose is leading thee. 
Thou seest, not vain the threats I bring thee: 
The lovely pictures they shall bring thee, 
That which the dainty spirits sing thee, 
With holy fire I'll scorch and sting thee! 
That fell asleep to long, long torment, and through thee? 
If I must share my chamber with thee, 
I'll stay with thee. 
Then may thine own son afterwards excel thee. 
Then may his teaching cheerfully impel thee: 
The glorified, from thee: 
Half God within thee! 
Look I not, eye to eye, on thee, 
Where first I looked on thee; 
Shame on thee! 
Great good, I hope, the thing will do thee. 
And much good may the liquor do thee! 
This nursing of the pain forego thee, 
Life be at last revealed to thee! 
I freely leave the choice to thee. 
The promise that I make to thee 
Then soon will others come to thee, 
Spare me! What have I done to thee? 
Why so? What has it done to thee? 
Woe to thee! 
Thou art a grandchild, therefore woe to thee! 
As did the Holy Ghost dictate to thee! 
My softest cushion I give to thee. 
What no man ever saw, I'll give to thee. 
The modest truth I speak to thee. 
Thou busy Spirit, how near I feel to thee! 
I've drowned the baby born to thee. 
                          What's that to thee? 
What boon I have, shall then be given unto thee. 
Ha! do I trap thee! 
So much have I already done for thee, 
I feel as though I'd lost my love for thee. 
So the mouse was not gray, enough for thee. 
O, what a blessed luck for thee! 
Would there were other work for thee! 
But in another book 'tis writ for thee, 
Of oil, he paints the spot for thee:-- 
Hush! hush! The hour is come that frees thee. 
Wrath takes thee! 
As best it pleases thee. 
For thee be speech divine! He loves thee! 
Ah, know'st thou what it means? He loves thee! 
Or I'll kiss thee! 
The pentagram prohibits thee? 
Wear shoes an ell in height,--the truth betrays thee, 
Let me not vainly entreat thee! 
I never chanced, in all my days, to meet thee! 
  Woe! I endure not thee! 
Not thee! 
I've heard, most fully, how she drew thee. 
The worst society thou find'st will show thee 
Thy guilty heart shall then dismay thee. 
Shalt not in a golden chain array thee, 
Poodle, stop that howling, prithee! 
     Then laughed the murderess in her glee: 
A little more, and they would bend the knee 
That, from this den released, and free, 
And fill thy goblet full and free! 
An easier space, and from the crowd be free: 
Take me thither! She shall be free! 
Then art thou from thy service free! 
  A shuttle free, 
Whence o'er the heart his empire free? 
What, Sir! you dare to make so free, 
See, now, the race is happy--it is free! 
Drove forth my feet through woods and meadows free, 
Say, dost thou know, my friend, whom thou mak'st free? 
Something immodest or unseemly free? 
He is a friend of mine, with whom it will agree, 
Spouses, who would fain agree, 
Opposing substances agree. 
Thereto I willingly agree, 
It overcomes me in such degree, 
I come, a squire of high degree, 
You've a visitor of high degree. 
        With his knights of high degree, 
By Three and One, and One and Three, 
     Make even three, 
And green alone Life's golden tree. 
     Therein I saw a cloven tree, 
At every step one strikes a rock or tree! 
Sees not the gardener, even while buds his tree, 
     I then beheld an apple-tree, 
Ah, dearest man, if but thy face I see, 
There fire and whirling smoke I see. 
Until, self-pleased, myself I see,-- 
Not a claw, no tail I see! 
Forsooth, if I am all I see, 
Ah, me! this dungeon still I see. 
Naught but a plain black poodle do I see. 
Again the street I see 
Here high and low contented see! 
Absurder than I ever yet did see. 
Ah, look and see--just look and see! 
     We speak and we see, 
Yet, therefore, no whit better men we see: 
Now that's your fault; from you we nothing see, 
Which there, behind, I glimmering see? 
The little world, and then the great, we'll see. 
If Man, that microcosmic fool, can see 
That scarce the world on holidays can see,-- 
And smells each article, to see 
You clasp the swelling hips, to see 
                  I've long been grieved to see 
And yet 'tis thou, so good, so kind to see! 
Within those bushes; I've a mind to see. 
My voice to hear, my countenance to see; 
Terrible to see! 
With fiery eyes, teeth terrible to see: 
I'd like, myself, such a one to see: 
It is so ugly, rough to see! 
'Tis deeds that I prefer to see: 
Thou goest, they stand in rows to see, 
Us as little insects see! 
And thou mine arts with joy shalt see: 
And yet the summit cannot see: 
No skinflint bargain shalt thou see. 
And thus the pious man you see 
The outer angle, you may see, 
Still wonder at your flights, enjoy the show they see: 
The sturdiest he-goat I would gladly see: 
Here lies one dead already--see! 
I never could learn the ways of life. 
Throbs to life! 
Invisible, visible, round thy life? 
Out of this lonely life 
The attempt, indeed, were a futile strife; 
Into the world of strife, 
He'll surely take her for his wife. 
_Then_ was the real golden age. 
That snatched him from the fever's rage 
They're now too far from what is just and sage. 
I feel in every limb the presage 
Day after to-morrow brings its message, 
But, I must beg you, of the oldest brewage; 
Away! Follow the ridge 
Over the bridge, 
If I such things but half can judge. 
For bread, in the widest sense, to drudge, 
Can do without, though, cold and scornful, he 
The clever scholar of the students, he! 
My servant, he! 
A poor, unknowing child! and he-- 
     As his own son were he. 
        And never more drank he! 
     And then as sore oppressed was he 
Surely a gallant man was he, 
Things worsen,--what improvement names he? 
When once inside the door comes he, 
That is the maid! the man is he! 
Obedience, more than ever, claims he, 
The elements of Life how conquers he? 
God forgive my husband, yet he 
Like "the Gods of Greece," must he

We fill with fresh wine, for your sake: 
And oft, to quiet it, my bed forsake, 
Who every flower for himself would take, 
And dandling back and forth the restless creature take, 
Aloft we'd fain ourselves betake. 
In very terror I at morn awake, 
The knave is outlawed! Cut him as you like! 
'Tis magic! Strike-- 
The Name is sound and smoke, 
Much the same way the preacher spoke, 
As I the thousand blossoms broke, 
Ha! in my heart what rending stroke! 
I feel thy presence, Spirit I invoke! 
In opening buds a marvel woke, 
     _Soar up, soar up, Dame Nightingale! 
Hear me relate the mournful tale! 
It's long been written in the Book of Fable;

The dearest child of Faith is Miracle. 
Finally she brings a great book, and stations in the circle 
(_He persuades_ FAUST _to step into the circle_.) 
And when upon his rump the leeches hang and fuddle, 
He now will seat him in the nearest puddle;

Wait a while! 
     And the fire-flies wink and darkle, 
Impotent showers of sleet that darkle 
     Crowded swarms that soar and sparkle, 
But the sun will permit no white to sparkle; 
Take him to the Northern Pole, 
All sorts of tender rigmarole, 
And if the wine be good, our praises shall be ample. 
Follow the ancient text, and the snake thou wast ordered to trample! 
But do not give too very small a sample; 
With all thy likeness to God, thou'lt yet be a sorry example! 
Paris in miniature, how it refines its people! 
(_In_ FAUST'S _long mantle_.) 
Thy prayers didst prattle, 
     He knows not the kettle! 
And sit down on the settle! 
With all my heart! Now, here's a bottle, 
Wherefrom, sometimes, I wet my throttle, 
        There was a King in Thule, 
spirits, and to condemning, unfeeling Man! And thou hast lulled me, 
I was confused, the like ne'er happened me; 
She has scored and has flayed me: 
Was it not given to thee and me? 
One ruin whelm both her and me! 
My wits, be certain, will befriend me. 
Thy cap and mantle straightway lend me! 
Ye angels, holy cohorts, guard me, 
Camp around, and from evil ward me! 
With turned-up nose each scamp may face me, 
With sneers and stinging taunts disgrace me, 
That I so boldly introduce me, 
See the wounds she has made me! 
Ah, within thine arms to hide me, 
Nobody else will lie beside me!-- 
To health in thy dewy fountains bathe me! 
And, freed from the fumes of lore that swathe me, 
Canst thou with lying flattery rule me, 
The woe, the rapture, so ensnare me, 
Which every valley richly bore me! 
Then bright mist veiled the world before me, 
The stubborn rocks before me 
She dwells within the dark, damp walls before me, 
I beg you, ladies, to excuse me. 
And thou didst kiss, as thou wouldst suffocate me-- 
Where once a heaven thy glances did create me, 
New strength and heart to meet the world incite me, 
Neither scruples nor doubts come now to smite me, 
And though the shock of storms may smite me, 
Despite me! 
The woe of earth, the bliss of earth, invite me, 
Thine am I, Father! rescue me! 
Only he loved to roam and leave me, 
Seeing, hearing, and thinking leave me. 
'Tis thou! Thou comest to save me, 
Therefore I'd never love, believe me! 
No, no! The paragon of all, believe me, 
A loss like this to death would grieve me. 
And when the lecture-halls receive me, 
One rapid glance within the mirror give me, 
As was my first, this world will hardly give me. 
I brought it up, and it was fond of me. 
It's too much, even for the like of me. 
Have led thy life, bereft of me? 
Help, Devil! through the coming pangs to push me; 
Let fall on me her fate, and also crush me,-- 
Above me heaven unfurled, the floor of waves beneath me,-- 
Of wings to lift the body can bequeath me. 
Thy powerful yearning moveth me, 
Come! Come with me! 
If thou feel'st it is I, then come with me! 
Mother is much too close with me. 
These crazy signs of witches' craft repel me! 
Then thou, at will, mayst question and compel me. 
Where is he? I heard him call me. 
I am free! No one shall enthrall me. 
Some pleasant news, at least, to tell me. 
I shall recover, dost thou tell me, 
Canst thou with rich enjoyment fool me, 
meanwhile, with the most insipid dissipations, hast concealed from me 
How comes it that thou dost not shrink from me?-- 
My breath takes from me, 
This once, the fancy wrought in me 
Whereto yearns every sense within me? 
The crown of all humanity to win me, 
So you but think a moment's space on me, 
False calves these many years upon me. 
Imprison me! 
'Twould only make the people shun me; 
Where art thou, Faust, whose voice has pierced to me, 
And many a comrade praised to me 
Posterity! Don't name the word to me! 
Saving Thy Gracious Presence, he to me 
     A dissolute dream once came to me: 
     A lovely dream once came to me; 
How comes that lovely casket here to me? 
Relate his life's sad close to me! 
Thou nam'st thyself a part, yet show'st complete to me? 
But _the Golden_ give to me, 
Madam, it is a grief to me; 
The jewels don't belong to me. 
I swear to you, 'tis like a dream to me. 
And if, this moment, came she in to me, 
If that prevents, how cam'st thou in to me? 
There com'st thou, hopping on to me! 
But what is all your fun to me? 
You rail, and it is fun to me. 
Omniscient am I not; yet much is known to me. 
                     Hither to me! 
And thus, thou'rt prisoner to me? 
My brother! God! such words to me? 
The one who brought such things to me." 
I must confess, it seems to me 
There, also, comes no rest to me, 
Attention! Hearken now to me! 
'Tis honor, profit, unto me. 
Then Time be finished unto me! 
Must leave, I fear me. 
One of us, dost hear me! 
I'll no longer suffer near me. 
That from her gaze I cannot tear me! 
And I, God's hate flung o'er me, 
A shudder, long unfelt, comes o'er me; 
Your courtesy doth flatter me: 
Clouds gather over me-- 
Oh, if you hear me, answer me! 
Why, just such talk as this, for me, 
Both clear and muddy streams, for me 
Then shalt thou do the same for me. 
I felt a world arise for me. 
At least, I hold it so much gain for me, 
Day? Yes, the day comes,--the last day breaks for me! 
I feel, the gentleman allows for me, 
Let that day be the last for me! 
This knotted staff suffices me. 
He loves me! 
And seizes me! 
He seeks me! 
Who calls me? 
Kiss me! 
Go! you'll laugh at me. 
Were I in _your_ place, do not doubt me, 
But knowledge worth having I fain would get me. 
My mother was hardly willing to let me; 
No crash of shipwreck shall have power to fright me! 
Nor Hell nor Devil can longer affright me. 
Are not their forces also lent me? 
Not me! 
Then to the cave secure thou leadest me, 
                   Thus thou pleasest me. 
Thou must! thou must! and though my life it cost me! 
I feel thee draw my heart, absorb, exhaust me: 
I won't go there, your jolly rows disgust me! 
And jolly rows and squabbles, trust me! 
And for another keep, meanwhile, my eyes about me. 
Come in, but gently: follow me! 
Upon my couch of sleep I lay me: 
Thy words will slay me! 
But some wild dream is sent to fray me. 
Do not affray me! 
Hasn't done his duty by me! 
As through the garden-gate I came? 
What is that? God in Heaven! Whence came

To greet and know the man of fame, 
Is that a devilish lying game? 
Hide thyself! Sin and shame 
No gems, that have not brought a maid to shame;

A little thievish and a little frolicsome. 
Of all the heavens the bright epitome? 
Here, Doctor, hold to me: in one jump we'll resume 
     We hear and we rhyme! 
The Evil One 
Try, then, the open window-pane! 
And Jurisprudence, Medicine,-- 
     Undine! 
And let it sparkle fresh and fine! 
And she made a to-do with her face so fine; 
Bravo! bravo! that was fine. 
  'Tis very fine! 
disgust. Mighty, glorious Spirit, who hast vouchsafed to me Thine 
As the first they must everywhere shine, 
Will that, too, prompt this heart of thine? 
Thou, Hell, hast claimed this sacrifice as thine! 
And head and virile forces--thine: 
Yea, if a magic mantle once were mine, 
There never was a sweeter fool than mine, 
The blade that is quivering over mine. 
You wanted them: I've given you mine. 
Is't thence less wholly mine? 
And as for bread, around a baker's door, in famine, 
She and her peace I yet must undermine: 
I feel impelled, its meaning to determine,-- 
The heart that on the dew of hope must pine! 
That breathes throughout this hallowed shrine! 
With impulse, mystic and divine, 
And he treated her always to pies and wine, 
I glow, as drunk with new-made wine: 
And yet it seemed as I were drinking wine. 
And foreign wenches and foreign wine, 
Hurrah for Freedom! Hurrah for wine! 
Champagne shall be my wine, 
Twice a swine! 
MEPHISTOPHELES (_dancing with the old one_) 
     Make ten of one, 
        Of such an one! 
Yonder, within the landlord's box of tools, there's one! 
Receive me now, I pray, as one 
     And nine is one, 
Nay, fear him not, my sweetest one! 
Like elephant-calves about one! 
Be Puck, himself, the stout one! 
Art thou, my gay one, 
Come here and listen, every one! 
     Then follow the witches, every one. 
Is something worth, to every one. 
     This is the witch's once-one's-one! 
Hell's fugitive stray-one? 
                   Done! 
        The pangs that wring my flesh and bone! 
_That_ knowledge cuts me to the bone. 
What shall therewith be done? 
     See, thus it's done! 
As his repulsive face has done. 
What's done has happed--what haps, is done! 
And truly 'tis not much, when all is done. 
        When once 'tis done 
And quicker yet 'tis done. 
Hast thou done? 
Ah, God! what hast thou done? 
The monkey! Is she gone? 
Besides, he's gone. 
        My peace is gone, 
        My peace is gone, 
        My peace is gone, 
So now, at the end, the flower is gone. 
As early to my clouded sight ye shone! 
     And there two fairest apples shone: 
Were but the ear-rings mine, alone! 
Not Art and Science serve, alone; 
(_at the spinning-wheel, alone_) 
Is in the beast: I see but drill, alone. 
But _Devil_ rhymes with _Doubt_ alone, 
No doubt you're much alone? 
You each, at home, are quite enough alone. 
The faith alone 
And so I nursed it all alone 
        For him alone; 
I hold the sceptre, here,--and lack the crown alone. 
Wherefore the hag, and her alone? 
Poor Son of Earth, how couldst thou thus alone 
Here, lost in thought, I've lingered oft alone, 
Toad-like, thy nourishment alone? 
In smaller circles one is not alone. 
Ah, if I only slept alone! 
I peeped at the owl in her nest alone: 
        Knowest Thou, and Thou alone! 
How grand a show! but, ah! a show alone. 
     And ten is none. 
So sit I, like the King upon his throne: 
There is, again, thy proper tone!-- 
I'm tired enough of this dry tone,-- 
There sits my mother upon a stone,-- 
There sits my mother upon a stone, 
Why suck'st, from sodden moss and dripping stone, 
And one is almost turned to stone. 
A few more steps ascend, as far as yonder stone!-- 
O'er the Ilsen-stone. 
What weave they there round the raven-stone? 
With youth and revel round you like a zone: 
And sway me from your misty, shadowy zone! 
Woe! woe! 
     Woe! woe! 
Perhaps he's even dead! Ah, woe!-- 
Woe! 
You're ravished quite, then comes a touch of woe, 
For the last time beheld my woe! 
And so we'll choose ourselves a Pope. 
Yet also we must have a ruling head, I hope, 
Ladies with him delighted are. 
     All in the air are 
ones, sits near and warms himself. Ceiling and walls are 
Torn lies the wreath, scattered the blossoms are. 
A starveling flame, ye blow it bare! 
Gave us so much of helping care. 
     We do not measure with such care: 
Nathless a parchment, writ and stamped with care, 
A fair young damsel took him in her care, 
And home I can go without your care. 
But none the more do others care. 
In exercising, with the strictest care, 
     If him------------------does not scare. 
My darling, who shall dare 
You cook the scraps from others' fare; 
A good man does his honest share 
That now our day of joy you share, 
Come, come along! It _must_ be, I declare! 
It's really shameful, I declare;-- 
My final ruin then declare! 
Ask priest or sage the answer to declare, 
One dares not that before chaste ears declare, 
     Like the fox in a snare, 
When she succeeds therewith a youth to snare, 
     Change place, and sense ensnare! 
Yet I betimes myself prepare 
Chiefly, enough of incident prepare! 
     Let him a-----------prepare, 
Of all I've seen, beyond compare; 
Which chaste hearts, notwithstanding, cannot spare; 
They come to look, and they prefer to stare. 
If him she gets, why let her beware! 
And come, devoted and sincere, 
They're poets, genuine and sincere. 
     Accurséd fere! 
Mankind's collected woe o'erwhelms me, here. 
A dog thou seest, and not a phantom, here! 
It is so close, so sultry, here! 
A short time, only, am I here, 
What rises up from the threshold here? 
And here! 
        Thus is He here! 
     Only believe there's a miracle here! 
Yet in the ranks, at once, we're here 
        Still are we native here. 
Here! 
Tis vain, this empty brooding here, 
Still many a man stands living here, 
And yet I cannot gain them here. 
I'll bring him here. 
I'll cut away, betimes, from here: 
Let us, with speed, away from here! 
To give that number is the custom here: 
I feel as if the organ here 
A single hour they've not been here. 
          Now, don't be so familiar here! 
Is there a magic vapor here? 
Who lies here? 
        The grave is here; 
What place of martyrdom is here! 
     What is that here? 
Bring me a gimlet here! 
        What dost thou here 
     Who are you here? 
In place of cheering drink, which one seeks vainly here, 
To order rigidly adhere; 
Thus, in our booth's contracted sphere, 
We'll try a wider sphere. 
Are we the sport of every changeful atmosphere? 
Let them drop down the golden atmosphere, 
Halt, there! Ho, there! 
Just see those handsome fellows, there! 
Instead of shooting here and there, 
     Be here--and there! 
I'll go ahead and introduce thee there, 
Both ease and grace will fail me there. 
Who's there? 
Hold fast, lest thou be hurled down the abysses there! 
  If the grave is there, 
[Illustration: _=If the grave is there, 
Mephisto, seest thou there, 
Who calls from the rocky cleft below there? 
     Quakes the old hell-lynx there. 
Thee, superhuman, shakes? Thy soul's high calling, where? 
(_boring a hole in the edge of the table, at the place where_ 
Don't be so terribly severe! 
(_Upon a low hearth stands a great caldron, under which a fire 
Abortion, thou, of filth and fire! 
And bachelors of youth and fire. 
MEPHISTOPHELES (_approaching the fire)_ 
And wilt thou be afraid of fire? 
Hast thou thy countenance revealed in fire. 
Within my breast he fans a lawless fire, 
Whereto our withered hearts aspire,-- 
        At last expire! 
When lovely maids, in fond desire, 
Thou, full of sensual, super-sensual desire, 
And in enjoyment pine to feel desire. 
I'm she: what does the gentleman desire? 
Society to one's desire! 
Whereon hang Heaven's and Earth's desire, 
        To heart's desire, 
Too young, to be without desire. 
'Twill warm thy heart with new desire: 
I'd draw the bolts to-night, for thy desire; 
Yes, knew I not more deeply thy desire. 
It fills the space entire, 
This life of earth, whatever my attire, 
Youth, good my friend, you certainly require 
For Martha Schwerdtlein I'd inquire! 
Which digs with eager hand for buried ore, 
Than if a sack of nuts he bore,-- 
This was the poodle's real core, 
They're from the Rhine! I guessed as much, before. 
I stand, no wiser than before: 
The learned gentleman I bow before: 
A most offensive song! Thank God, each morning, therefore, 
And is not apt, without a why or wherefore, 
And here, poor fool! with all my lore 
Refreshment shall his lips in vain implore-- 
Let us the sensual deeps explore, 
Its germs, productive powers explore, 
So, dream thy dreams, O Faust, until we meet once more! 
The wider circle he acquires, the more 
And he lamented his ill fortune all the more. 
And thanked no less, and thanked no more 
And rummage in empty words no more! 
She slept so long that she wakes no more. 
Thou gav'st the comrade, whom I now no more 
Miserable Faust! I know thee now no more. 
And fancies there are no favors more, 
I dare not go: there's no hope any more. 
        Ah, nevermore! 
        Ah, nevermore! 
        Ah, nevermore! 
        Departeth nevermore! 
To stick in shallow trash forevermore,-- 
Still were he lost forevermore! 
What seek I? Why so full my heart, and sore? 
        My heart is sore: 
        My heart is sore: 
        My heart is sore: 
Besides, his penitence was very sore, 
Nor honors, save for him in store; 
Through the impervious veil it wore! 
[Illustration: =Prelude at the Theatre=] 
I verily see a theatre. 
Cursed, also, Hope!--cursed Faith, the spectre! 
I'd praise you if I found you snugly in the centre, 
On _words_ let your attention centre! 
I, for a time, at least, have worked thy cure; 
Past earthly joys he might secure. 
But such a course thou wilt not long endure; 
As forwards, onwards, ever must endure; 
I'll not be led by any lure 
Though ugly faces he allure, 
They go their way with looks demure, 
'Twas something better than manure,-- 
So sweetly virtuous and pure, 
Ariel's song is heavenly-pure, 
The Devil must be something, sure,-- 
Half-rotten straw: and yet, he died a Christian, sure, 
To madness and to horror, sure. 
Had I not been, so hadst thou, sure, 
They praise us half in pity, sure: 
And I shall have thee fast and sure!-- 
And yet a little pert, be sure! 
The gentleman's too kind, I'm sure. 
But they'll accept us, after all, I'm sure. 
And teach thy pulses of youth and pleasure 
What would I not, to give thee pleasure? 
Shalt soon experience the pleasure, 
To share with him the pleasure. 
Yet in each soul is born the pleasure 
And, once for all, I grudge thee not the pleasure 
With every hope of future pleasure, 
And soon thou'lt be aware, with keenest thrills of pleasure, 
I'd treat these worthy guests, with pleasure, 
So I am here with pleasure. 
'Twould bring, for all my sinful pleasure, 
        Calling to pleasure, 
What ails you now? Is't suffering, or pleasure? 
     Has wrought for our pleasure. 
This and the other question, at your pleasure. 
Your company shall give us pleasure. 
To waft me o'er the world at pleasure, 
I came, with lust of instant pleasure, 
Will the dog, like man, snarl _his_ displeasure? 
Of lying to thyself in moderate measure. 
Whisks and whirls in measure: 
Finding them often hard to measure: 
But three drops of it measure, 
Forgiveness in the richest measure. 
Since bravery was paid in fullest measure, 
Breathing her atmosphere in fullest measure. 
     For he, without measure, 
To love by rule, and hate by measure! 
I feel, indeed, that I have made the treasure 
And think they're near the treasure: 
I would not for the costliest stores of treasure-- 
The noble indolence I'll teach thee then to treasure, 
Forfeit so wantonly, to swell your treasure? 
To some from out our cellar's treasure. 
To lift the kettle with its treasure. 
That to the Soldan bore a mighty treasure. 
And if I now sit down in restful leisure, 
To-morrow, though, I'll ask, in Easter leisure, 
Is it permitted that we share your leisure? 
And lie dissolved in dreams of love's sweet leisure! 
Of the Four, no feature 
I've scarce the heart to plague the wretched creature. 
Ah, when one studies thus, a prisoned creature, 
But what do I see in the creature? 
Lurks in the creature. 
To help or convert a fellow-creature. 
Is that in the course of nature? 
Yes, when the priest comedian is by nature, 
Man's misery even to pity moves my nature; 
Come, bind thyself by prompt indenture, 
        Bold is the venture, 
        Bold is the venture, 
In this sense, even, canst thou venture. 
To yield one wholly, and to feel a rapture 
(_With a gesture_:) 
(_He makes an indecent gesture_.) 
When o'er our heads, lost in the vaulted azure, 
To bear false witness in a case? 
But think, the chances of the case! 
As Dilettante I the curtain raise. 
None ever found a thing to praise. 
But time through order may be won, I promise. 
_with great noise_.) 
Reason and Knowledge only thou despise, 
'Tis trying to rise, 
My hands are empty, otherwise. 
Seek thou the honest recompense! 
I see you have your fun at our expense. 
With little art, clear wit and sense 
That, to his hot, insatiate sense, 
     With clearer sense, 
Who knows not their sense 
And, if they've not bewitched my sense, 
And for the sense and power intense 
I've led my scholars by the nose,-- 
I sat in unconcerned repose, 
And heard the swagger as it rose. 
And, haply, ere one travels half the course 
Of course. 
Which binds the world, and guides its course; 
Wherein, Sirs, can I be of use? 
That which one does not know, one needs to use; 
MARTHA (_coming from the house_) 
And when a corpse approaches, close my house: 
It goes with me, as with the cat the mouse. 
When I have sat at some carouse. 
     Through all Heaven impermeate, 
The waggish knave least trouble doth create. 
To restless action spurs our fate! 
And blest is he, who has the lucky fate, 
And Nature shuts on me her gate. 
Out of the hollow, gloomy gate, 
(_They pass in the city-gate_.) 
I see stark-nude young witches congregate, 
Within my deepest, inmost soul I hate. 
If there we cherish love or hate, 
The like of thee have never moved My hate. 
This time, thine eyes be satiate! 
Yes, Sir, 'tis late. 
The motley throngs come forth elate: 
That arbitrarily, here, ourselves we isolate. 
        The man who with thee goes, thy mate, 
     The One, unoriginate, 
You are so kind, compassionate. 
Alack, that men are so unfortunate! 
(_He disappears with_ FAUST: _the revellers start and separate_.) 
             Tis time to separate. 
(_Heaven closes: the_ ARCHANGELS _separate_.) 
You almost like a Frenchman prate; 
Indeed? he'd like mankind to imitate! 
For thou hast torn me from that desperate state 
My proper place is thy estate: 
How is it? under way? and soon complete? 
A contradiction thus complete 
     At once, whene'er they bite! 
     At once, whene'er they bite. 
For what one has, in black and white, 
Much error, and of truth a glimmering mite, 
Nor nearer, to the Infinite, 
"In the Beginning was the _Act_," I write. 
I think, how useful 'tis to write; 
And then, observe for whom you write! 
Without that, I have appetite. 
Enter not so stall-fed quite, 
If one comes bored, exhausted quite, 
Not so: the memory of it touched him quite. 
And mother's case seemed hopeless quite, 
I cannot understand you quite. 
Scattering through gardens and fields remote, 
And yet, from childhood up familiar with the note, 
Quite right! The mark I also note. 
Here, set it in the press, with haste! 
Seize it in haste! 
Don't be a Devil stiff as paste, 
But get fresh jewels to her taste! 
O pardon, Sir, the rough salute! 
     I offer here my best salute 
We will no longer lose a minute; 
I cannot loosen the bonds of the Avenger, nor undo his bolts. Rescue 
     Then honor to whom the honor is due! 
Don't be so proud! I'll hold my tongue, 
How ill it suits the Artist, proud and true! 
God! was so good, so dear, so true! 
Is dead? Alas, that heart so true! 
Yes, the poor women are bad off, 'tis true: 
The Devil taught the thing, 'tis true, 
Age childish makes, they say, but 'tis not true; 
FAUST (_struggling to leave_) 
For further visits thou hast leave. 
Whence, willingly, the comrade him I gave, 
What! shall the Poet that which Nature gave, 
        A golden goblet gave. 
Go, find yourself a more obedient slave! 
  Birth and the Grave, 
I go to God as a soldier brave. 
Unqualified repose he learns to crave; 
Dumb lies the world like the grave! 
Now through the slumber of the grave 
        Was faithful till the grave,-- 
And hope, before my last step to the grave, 
Had he not made himself the Devil's, naught could save 
Yet something from a tour I always save, 
  A fluctuant wave, 
     Look through the sieve! 
What means the sieve? 
Why thou shouldst ask, I don't perceive. 
Judgment of God! myself to thee I give. 
Let us, then, such a drama give! 
Over me could give? 
Must something fresh for their advantage give. 
And each awaits the banquet I shall give. 
So long the host may credit give, 
If unto me full leave you give, 
And so, though even God forgive, 
If I do him wrong, may God forgive! 
And I think the man a knave, as I live! 
On earth a damned existence live! 
Especially since it lives and lets me live; 
Have mercy on me, let me live! 
As long as he on earth shall live, 
Grasp the exhaustless life that all men live! 
Confess, Sirs, I know how to live. 
They merrily and careless live. 
Thou shalt live. 
He shall not leave the spot alive. 
If _he's_ one, let me at him drive! 
     Rapture and Love! 
Along the shining path of Love?

In brooding souls the sunset burn above? 
MARTHA (_as above_) 
MEPHISTOPHELES (_as above_) 
FAUST (_as above_) 
The whirlpool swirls to get above: 
The other strongly sweeps, this dust above, 
Thou'rt shoved thyself, imagining to shove. 
One with tenacious organs holds in love 
Dear love! 
Art with the Devil hand and glove, 
For this performance I your debtor prove.-- 
          Christ no more found we! 
          Cleanlily wound we: 
Enamored persons here have we, 
That our Papa Satan we 
Must we? 
And yet, this once my thanks I owe 
Ye crowd more near! Then, be the reign assigned ye, 
Shall I attempt, this once, to seize and bind ye? 
Again ye come, ye hovering Forms! I find ye, 
To let it go at last, so please ye, 
Each asks, and presses near to gaze; 
And when the perfect moon before my gaze 
Here burns the glow through film and haze: 
Mammon in the mountain blaze. 
Whence one seeth, with amaze, 
I stand ashamed and in amaze, 
What says the sage, now first I recognize: 
And me, thou angel! didst thou recognize, 
At night, one learns his house to prize:-- 
        His noble size, 
And after--first and foremost duty--Of 
     Wert thou the thief, 
     Know'st thou the thief, 
        Unto no thief 
        Be warm and lief, 
        Love's time is brief: 
(_She springs to her feet: the fetters fall off_.) 
Down with it quickly! Drain it off! 
'Tis very well, that once one tries the stuff, 
of you men runs wild. Why didst thou enter into fellowship with us, if 
What ails thee? What is't gripes thee, elf? 
     Bring help to hearth and shelf. 
Thee, me, Himself?

Reveal thyself!

A horror from the vaulted roof, 
Their very plaudits give my heart a pang, 
And still, alas! the echoes first that rang! 
Uninterrupted gushed and sprang! 
Ah! in the midst of it there sprang 
While yet in joyous growth I sang,-- 
The souls, to whom my earliest songs I sang: 
That in the dance so sweetly sang? 
     To the enticing 
     Whirl of their dancing! 
THE FAIR ONE (_dancing_) 
THE WITCH (_dancing_) 
FAUST (_dancing_) 
     See, the entrancing 
When you have learned, all things reducing, 
That was a promenading! 
At village and dance parading! 
At night, our times of peace abiding. 
Where is he? If I catch the scoundrel hiding, 
And sees all sorts of ships go down the river gliding: 
I saw him with these eyes upon a wine-cask riding 
The All-enfolding, 
From Water, Earth, and Air unfolding, 
It makes me furious, such things beholding: 
The All-upholding, 
     Still increasing and expanding! 
     Tell me, if we still are standing, 
Now we are already again at the end of our wits, where the understanding 
No, no,--no ending! no ending! 
Day after day, the same thing, never-ending. 
Soaring up, sweeping down, bowing and bending! 
Who, in his dusky work-shop bending, 
Here, over this green arbor bending, 
     Waveringly bending, 
     Or if further we're ascending? 
Like heavenly forces rising and descending, 
Their golden urns reciprocally lending, 
     All is turning, whirling, blending, 
     Longing unending 
Made, from his recipes unending, 
See what a vine! what grapes depending! 
And then the marketing and kitchen-tending, 
Thus we, our hellish boluses compounding, 
Among these vales and hills surrounding, 
At once to set about rewarding. 
Methinks, instead of in the forests lording, 
And bear me forth to new and varied being! 
Trembles through all the depths of being, 
Deny His being, 
And shall a promise bind my being? 
'Twixt Heaven and Earth on potent errands fleeing, 
Shall stand, with all my future days agreeing? 
_He_ art thou, who, my presence breathing, seeing, 
Who, feeling, seeing, 
     Thousand-colored, herd-wise hieing 
     Life-ward all hieing,-- 
Thus, at the breasts of Wisdom clinging, 
Hear'st thou voices higher ringing? 
Thou'lt find each day a greater rapture bringing. 
Far away, or nearer singing? 
And feel'st not, thronging 
A chain of deepest action forging 
And with tremendous, oft-repeated urging, 
And rival storms abroad are surging 
For 'tis my pleasure-to behold them surging, 
        And the soldiers go marching, 
And from your heap of ashes hatching 
You sit forever gluing, patching; 
     In the last convulsion twitching. 
My horses are neighing: 
Still in my feet the fright like lead is weighing. 
Each on the other is dashing, 
     Wine, that is dashing 
     Of foaming and flashing 
In frightfully intricate crashing 
I saw, among the rest, a thing 
I'm but a silly, fearsome thing! 
        Good-night to thee, poor thing! 
The poor, poor thing! 
Reprobate! Name not that fairest thing, 
     A hollow thing,-- 
Has given my heart so keen a pang of loathing, 
In all my life there's nothing 
Withdrawn to the mountains, a crownless king: 
Boughs are groaning and breaking, 
The ocean-tides in foam are breaking, 
The evergreen palaces shaking! 
And both, the spheric race partaking, 
FAUST _(awaking)_ 
FAUST _(unlocking)_ 
Only fall to, and show no timid balking. 
But thou hast heard, 'tis not of joy we're talking. 
     'Tis thoughts, and we're thinking! 
I'll teach you how to grin, I'm thinking. 
I'll worm their secret out, I'm thinking. 
That also with them goes material for thinking! 
A fine young fellow's presence, to my thinking, 
That men _will_ have it, there's no blinking: 
Yonder afar, from the hill-paths blinking, 
Sit'st thou, as 'twere an owl a-blinking? 
I fain would drink with you, my glass to Freedom clinking, 
Why here to caverns, rocky hollows slinking, 
Is no one laughing? no one drinking? 
I hasten on, his beams eternal drinking, 
Let me alone! I'll set them first to drinking, 
If 'twere a better wine that here I see you drinking. 
All from the fellowship of fools are shrinking. 
And overladen, nigh to sinking, 
My own head, now, is really nigh to sinking. 
Yet, finally, the weary god is sinking; 
     Vanish, ye darking 
     Some of them scaling 
Unwisely frank, with hearts that spurned concealing, 
That with this wench 'twere very easy dealing. 
Have all one source, one mode of healing; 
These chants, to youth and all its sports appealing, 
Or oft, reluctant years its warrant sealing, 
My troubled heart to joy unsealing, 
With calm across my tumult stealing, 
The powers of Nature here, around my path, revealing? 
Now failing, now, perchance, success revealing,-- 
I scarce can stand, my knees are trembling! 
I find a box, the first resembling, 
The colors of hope to the valley cling, 
And to the mob laid bare each thought and feeling, 
You'll ne'er attain it, save you know the feeling, 
Ah, every utterance from the depths of feeling 
And Memory holds me now, with childish feeling, 
To lead the women, learn the special feeling! 
He seemed to have the sudden feeling 
And through thy frame the liquor's potence fling. 
     Others are sailing, 
     Fright us, weirdest links uncoiling 
     Through the sand and boulders toiling, 
     O that the darkling 
     Starlight is sparkling, 
On the threshold he stood, and _Margaret_! calling, 
The night is falling. 
Midst of Hell's howling and noises appalling, 
comrade crazy, rude, repelling: 
Serene in primal strength, compelling 
Thou'lt find, this drink thy blood compelling, 
From such a face as thine there is no telling. 
        He saw it plunging and filling, 
This fiddling, shouting, ten-pin rolling 
They rave, as Satan were their sports controlling. 
Sweet darling! 
A single scarlet band is gleaming, 
     In silk and velvet gleaming 
     Had a coat with ribbons streaming, 
That like a cataract, down rocks and gorges foaming, 
I am the fugitive, all houseless roaming, 
No broader than a knife-blade seeming! 
In scarlet coat, with golden trimming, 
A cloak in silken lustre swimming, 
I hear the distant drumming. 
Where I and Martha wait thy coming. 
MARTHA (_coming_) 
The bittern's changeless booming." 
And the garden, brightly blooming, 
Mere curiosity their spirits warming: 
Without a salary their parts performing. 
MARGARET (_attentively listening_) 
     There was a king once reigning, 
There was a king once reigning, 
Ah, if I leave this spot with fond designing, 
     And loved him past explaining, 
Where you, ye beasts? Founts of all Being, shining, 
And rise not, on us shining, 
A woman's form, in beauty shining! 
And must I find her body, there reclining, 
Ye flow, ye feed: and am I vainly pining? 
Shalt thou sponge through the term beginning! 
With what delight, what profit winning, 
It seems to me that with enchanted cunning 
I see him timidly, in doubt, around us running, 
Vile din! yet one must learn to bear the crooning. 
Which elsewhere I have just been earning. 
Thine obligation newly earning. 
A sweet, uncomprehended yearning 
And grasps me now a long-unwonted yearning 
Well, Margaret soon will still your yearning: 
Both flower and fruit the future years adorning? 
I soon shall lead him to a clearer morning. 
        As in the early morning 
A hundred fires along the ranks are burning. 
And while a thousand tears were burning, 
I thrill and tremble; tear on tear is burning, 
Ah, bravo! Do I find you burning? 
My song, to faint Aeolian murmurs turning, 
Be quick! I see her there, returning. 
over the spot where the victim fell, and lie in wait for the returning 
I hear the noise of instruments attuning,-- 
With fire on fire your throbbing forehead crowning, 
Only when meadow, field, and you are drowning. 
I know not what they are brewing and doing. 
I, too, was fair, and that was my undoing. 
     Cover, in going, 
As if with fettered feet that stay her going. 
Make merry when the dance is going! 
For this, all pleasure am I foregoing; 
As thou, up yonder, with running and leaping 
I much prefer the cheeks where ruddy blood is leaping, 
To no one hope of mine--not one--its promise keeping:-- 
     Within whose dread and holy keeping 
And never cared to have them in my keeping. 
So now I take thee into my keeping, 
And mother, in her notions of housekeeping, 
     Behind me, field and meadow sleeping, 
        Alone, and ah! unsleeping, 
And so, as bachelor, into his grave a-creeping, 
        I'm weeping, weeping, weeping, 
Upon the verge of bitter weeping, 
MARTHA (_weeping_) 
We have no maid: I do the knitting, sewing, sweeping, 
This round and round the world in freedom sweeping; 
     Trees on trees beside us trooping, 
     And the crags above us stooping, 
Not even a jewel, not a ring, 
     Like glass doth ring, 
        But with the wedding-ring! 
There was a Lion red, a wooer daring, 
A cavalier am I, like others in my bearing. 
So long the poor boy waits a hearing, 
See, here's the coat-of-arms that I am wearing! 
swearing! 
Which through the firmament diffused is faring, 
Upon its track to follow, follow soaring! 
In every quarter is preparing. 
By all love ever rejected! By hell-fire hot and unsparing! 
And both, tormented then by flame unsparing, 
Nor the desire for her sweet body bring 
My body's chill and shuddering,-- 
     In beauty bewildering, 
_which blazes out the chimney. The_ WITCH _comes careering 
I hear one's footsteps, hither steering. 
(_Whispering_) 
FAUST (_whispering_) 
FAUST (_entering_) 
Take children's, monkeys' gaze admiring, 
        We, his aspiring 
     Hark, the inspiring 
But ne'er from heart to heart you'll speak inspiring, 
        Weeping, desiring, 
     Sound of their quiring! 
MEPHISTOPHELES (_boring_) 
     Deploring 
It yonder hastes, new fields of life exploring; 
     The beauty perished beyond restoring. 
By the quickening glance of the gracious Spring; 
     How soon will't spring, 
The one almighty force enduring,-- 
Thine endless love, thy faith assuring, 
Here is a song, which, if you sometimes sing, 
ALL (_sing_) 
Filling the All with harmony unceasing! 
Yet, Lord, Thy messengers are praising 
     Dipping and rising 
Thou wouldst be devil enough to grudge my soul the blessing. 
Ah, those were the days of blessing! 
With wings that winnow blessing 
It is the greatest heavenly blessing, 
She slept, while we were caressing: 
To have a dear thing for one's caressing. 
(_She begins to sing while undressing_) 
From Heaven through Earth I see them pressing, 
        Beyond expressing, 
But, if thou hadst the power of guessing, 
        Ah, past guessing, 
And hast unlearned thy kissing? 
My friend, so short a time thou'rt missing, 
To classify them for your using. 
With what fierce blows upon my neck 'tis beating! 
One only fear still needs repeating: 
Take not unkindly its repeating: 
Sang, God's new Covenant repeating? 
Under the old ribs of the rock retreating, 
[Illustration: _Under the old ribs of the rock retreating_,] 
Much of his cousins did he speak, entreating 
A chance-dropped word may set me sweating! 
Thyself to Godhood haughtily inflating; 
You pass the night in dissipating:-- 
What time takes she for dissipating? 
All Heaven and Earth in rapture penetrating; 
And Life, alas! is fleeting. 
The art is long, the time is fleeting. 
Full many a place of meeting. 
Greet her? Not I: unless, when meeting, 
And oft, with zeal my critic-duties meeting, 
To smash her windows be a greeting! 
Your husband's dead, and sends a greeting. 
That we should give to each his kindly greeting. 
Thy life disquieting 
The foreign people are a-fighting. 
While we to warm our paws are waiting. 
Beckons afar, the race awaiting; 
Who makes Olympus sure, the Gods uniting? 
Who braids the noteless leaves to crowns, requiting 
Systems to words 'tis easy suiting; 
The crowd for strongest drink is panting, 
Full well you know what here is wanting; 
Who'll help me to my footing? 
In star and fire light shooting, 
Mists rise,--red, angry rays are darting 
        With anguish smarting, 
A travelling scholar, then? The _casus_ is diverting. 
A stubborn bachelor there's no converting. 
And I should turn to better ways than flirting. 
With even devils consorting. 
All instruments are fitting; 
Must use the tools that best are fitting. 
They've danced already more than fitting. 
May honor as is fitting. 
The cither's smashed! For nothing more 'tis fitting. 
To my impertinence befitting, 
As in the mouths of puppets are befitting! 
With maxims most pragmatical and hitting, 
With sharpest nippers flitting, 
There's yet a skull I must be splitting! 
Reflect, soft wood is given to you for splitting, 
Those two, the old one with the young one sitting, 
And, like a bankrupt debtor sitting, 
As the Cathedral thou wert quitting? 
     CHORUS (_shouting_) 
     CHORUS (_shouting_) 
With words 'tis excellent disputing; 
        For us be suing,-- 
I see the plan thou art pursuing: 
     His thirst in puddles laving; 
     But nothing cured his raving. 
No word can ever lose a jot from thieving. 
The villain! From his children thieving! 
On words 'tis excellent believing; 
Day's Eden-brightness still relieving 
Though some familiar tone, retrieving 
And sweet, clear echoes came, deceiving 
And swift, and swift beyond conceiving, 
She could not think, herself, of giving 
Thousands were done to death from poison of my giving; 
And a bad conscience sharper misery giving! 
Before folks, lest there be misgiving: 
My friend, thou soon shalt lose all such misgiving: 
And I must hear, by all the living, 
My future sweetheart, just as he were living. 
Be thou but self-possessed, thou hast the art of living! 
Could not prevent his shameful way of living! 
The poor wee thing its natural living; 
It is so wretched, forced to beg my living, 
How Cupid stirs and leaps, on light and restless wing. 
     Hear them snoring, hear them blowing! 
  A weaving, flowing 
     O'er the stones, the grasses, flowing 
No dagger's here, that set not blood to flowing; 
Shalt not, in lace and ribbons flowing, 
The silver brook to golden rivers flowing. 
I view, through all my senses swiftly flowing! 
     Garments, out-flowing, 
The silent world beneath me glowing, 
Poured speedy death, in poison glowing: 
     They, with their glowing 
In every vein and fibre newly glowing. 
  Life, all-glowing, 
She falters on, her way scarce knowing, 
I do not pretend to aught worth knowing, 
     And the rocky snouts, outgrowing,-- 
Here could I spend whole hours, delaying: 
Why! If the fount of wine should still be playing? 
          Their kirtles all were playing. 
Here Nature shaped, as if in sportive playing, 
          The fiddle-bow was playing. 
          And the fiddle-bow was playing. 
Useless talking, delaying and praying! 
            Himself with care arraying: 
          Waylaying and betraying! 
          And hips and elbows straying. 
          "Be decent while you're staying!" 
Forsooth, the eyes they are of one whom, dying, 
        To whom his mistress, dying, 
  I stood beside his bed of dying. 
        When came his time of dying, 
And what I lost, grows real and undying. 
     Sounds of hope, of love undying! 
Then bind me in thy bonds undying, 
            Who stood, the dance surveying: 
And found that heavier scores to his account were lying. 
That is the breast whereon I once was lying,-- 
In Padua buried, he is lying 
What I possess, I see far distant lying, 
     For the wanderer. Mice are flying, 
     Others are flying; 
Or snatch a rapid bliss in flying, 
Joy follows woe, woe after joy comes flying. 
When thus I hail the Moment flying: 
        Naught else to his heir denying 
Without return to be enjoying. 
Thou shouldst not find it so annoying, 
     Are they all awake and crying? 
Whether you everywhere be trying, 
There flames a desolation, blazing 
  (_Dance and Song_.) 
Whom but to see, puts out the fire of Song! 
That unrelieved, our whole life long, 
Ah, God! but Art is long, 
     The way is wide, the way is long: 
Day long, and half night long. 
Her time is miserably long; 
Yes, the mountain's side along, 
And in its whirlpool forces us along! 
That one, two, three! thereto belong. 
I hate,--these noises of the throng: 
Invoke not thus the well-known throng, 
The purer joys that round the Poet throng,-- 
Now, while the sky leads forth its starry throng, 
     See, what a wild and crazy throng! 
Like eating and drinking, free and strong,-- 
One first perceives the bass is deep and strong. 
It smiled, and tumbled, and grew strong. 
In head and breast there's something wrong. 
And danger thousand-fold, our race to wrong. 
Give us a song! 
Lulled in my lap with many a song, 
When the vault echoes to the song, 
Sweeps an infuriate glamouring song! 
(_in alternating song_) 
Such is the everlasting song 
A nasty song! Fie! a political song-- 
I'll sing her, first, a moral song, 
"Were I a little bird!" so runs her song, 
And call it mirth, and call it song!

And I am yet so young, so young! 
Dear me, how fine! So handsome, and so young!

     And Reason then resumes her speech: 
My own disgust is strengthened by your speech: 
Through spirit-power and spirit-speech, 
is burning. Various figures appear in the vapors which 
FAUST (_dancing with the young witch_) 
A man can think and know so much? 
Dear God! However is it, such 
And all the caps are lifted high; 
And blessed myself, and boasted high,-- 
     Suns are on high. 
I have myself inflated all too high; 
Behind her chair, was listening nigh. 
Custom, or not! It happens, though. 
And you look as though 
Have you not led this life quite long enough? 
And mix things madly through and through, 
That runs, quicksilver-like, one's fingers through,-- 
     Sylph! 
Good! if I have the choice, so let the wine be Rhenish! 
Our Fatherland can best the sparkling cup replenish. 
My mind its fairest work to finish! 
With wilful cavil would diminish, 
Within a narrow sphere to flourish; 
With unmixed food thy body nourish; 
I offer it, and humbly wish 
The end of that far-spreading death 
     Who put me to death; 
My mother have I put to death; 
Demeans me to myself, and with a breath, 
When, after dancing out your breath, 
When from the hard-won goal the wreath 
One sees that in nothing no interest he hath: 
     Who eaten me hath! 
As if stood before you, gray and loath, 
Seeketh a path 
With terrible wrath 
And half in wrath: 
The bloody laurels on the brow he bindeth! 
In clasping maiden-arms he findeth! 
     Gems, as it boundeth 
     And spreading, surroundeth 
Come! come! The night already vanisheth. 
But, much as my heart to see thee yearneth, 
        Why it trembleth, why it yearneth, 
        Why this anxious heart so burneth, 
The secret horror of him returneth; 
Now like a tender thread it creepeth, 
Here steam, there rolling vapor sweepeth; 
Ah! 
His spirit's ferment far aspireth; 
And all the Near and Far that he desireth 
The fairest stars from Heaven he requireth, 
He will brighten the world with the tints he loveth, 
Everywhere form in development moveth; 
Here, rich in hope and firm in faith, 
Tis Lilith. 
God help us! that is done with: 
We've but naked soles to run with. 
What use, in having that to play with? 
How many have I made away with! 
Physics and Metaphysics both! 
Hear, therefore, one alone, for that is best, in sooth, 
The Devil needs a rat's quick tooth. 
Lies not beneath us, firm, the earth? 
In misery! In despair! Long wretchedly astray on the face of the earth, 
        Ah! to the woe of earth 
The proverb says: One's own warm hearth 
        Is He, in glow of birth, 
Many the corpses carried forth, 
I'll venture, then, to bear thee forth. 
(_Pedestrians of all kinds come forth_.) 
Would I were forth! 
(_The_ WITCH _breaks the circle_: FAUST _steps forth_.) 
Here words and prayers are nothing worth; 
And a good wife, are gold and jewels worth. 
If from the Desert sendeth them the South, 
        The smile of his mouth, 
        And kiss his mouth, 
The West leads on a host, to cure the drouth 
Dost thou thy father honor, as a youth? 
Then also you, though but a youth, 
I nothing had, and yet enough for youth-- 
Therefore I've worn, like many a spindly youth, 
Joy in Illusion, ardent thirst for Truth. 
Dost thou, as man, increase the stores of truth? 
And, as regards the foot, which I can't spare, in truth, 
And simply take your master's words for truth.

Explain, before you further speak, 
As when to spirits spirits speak. 
Then at the wash-tub stand, at morning's break; 
To see the day of disappointment break,

Get me a little wax, to make the stoppers, quick! 
Be quick! Be quick!

(_A knock_). 
     And so they go over stone and stock; 
     Bears the broom and bears the stock, 
     The witch she-----s, and-----s the buck. 
     Bears the fork and bears the buck: 
And Nature's wise instruction seek, 
On summer holidays to seek 
The special faculty you seek. 
Among this crowd of merry folk, 
That, as the drops below its brink, 
Here is a phial: in her drink 
So many days of life you drink! 
And deepest sleep will on her senses sink. 
And from the worn and fingered book 
(_begins to declaim, with much emphasis, from the book_) 
That naught is said but what is in the book: 
(_He writes, and returns the book_.) 
From page to page, from book to book! 
So you can better watch, and look 
One soon fatigues, on woods and fields to look, 
O tremble not! but let this look, 
Up by the brook, 
On the door-bench, in the passage dark, 
     Drizzle, whistling through the dark. 
You are the master of the house, I mark, 
The length of the time they'd never mark. 
Or I'll blow out his being's flickering spark! 
     The magic notes, like spark on spark, 
I tell you, give but more--more, ever more, they ask: 
To satisfy them is a task.-- 
But then, alas! they've read an awful deal. 
I will confess, I knew not what appeal 
The hallowed Original 
You now oppose the fist infernal, 
Trust one of us, this Whole supernal 
And call this ardor, so supernal, 
_He_ dwells in splendor single and eternal, 
Endless, eternal and eternal,-- 
In yielding, that must be eternal! 
So, to the actively eternal 
And towards a self-erected goal 
     There gathers the crowd for carnival: 
Yet here a huge embarrassment I feel: 
     As 'twere five hundred hogs, we feel 
But I was angry with myself, to feel 
And move, as we deliberately impel, 
If one is prim and good, as ancient rules compel: 
For now, thy vapors to dispel, 
To don the self-same gay apparel, 
A long, sharp sword for show or quarrel,-- 
To gnaw it where, with just a morsel 
The fact is easy to unravel, 
Their air's so odd, they've just returned from travel: 
Man's active nature, flagging, seeks too soon the level; 
They're mountebanks, upon a revel. 
Wilt thou, to introduce us to the revel, 
Ah, dearest dame, let not your courage fail! 
     Ten thousand times my sweetheart hail!_ 
     A rag will answer for a sail; 
     To cheer the witch will salve avail; 
That scarcely more is left me to fulfil. 
At Padua rest, in consecrated soil. 
Ah, that no wing can lift me from the soil, 
_Sancta simplicitas_! no need of such a toil; 
The glow retreats, done is the day of toil; 
And yet, beyond a cavil, 
presence! Imprisoned! In irretrievable misery! Delivered up to evil 
So humanly to gossip with the Devil! 
Would e'er these people scent the Devil! 
Who works, excites, and must create, as Devil. 
Also be a devil. 
Assume the part of wizard or of devil? 
And have a care to be most civil: 
tail set wagging: canine habits, all! 
As they are seen by each and all. 
Spirit sublime, thou gav'st me, gav'st me all 
I speed along, completest man of all, 
And cursed be Patience most of all! 
Point your fingers and nip them all! 
     Before us go the women all. 
Feeling is all in all: 
     Sir Urian sits over all. 
With honest purpose, once for all, 
Had I but seven hours for all, 
        And bitterness all. 
My spirit cannot practise it at all. 
Thy fancy's rickets plague thee not at all: 
The narrow being suits me not at all. 
Is nothing but the spirit of you all, 
But, let us go! 'Tis gray and dusky all: 
     The world's the ball: 
Why does he come, then, to our ball? 
Then cease to bore us at our ball! 
Walked thyself off this earthly ball 
I should not on the Devil call, 
What you the Spirit of the Ages call 
Then to thine aid the witch must call. 
     Doth rise and fall, 
The air is cold, the vapors fall. 
The highest favor Love lets fall! 
O, everywhere on him you fall! 
Every flea may it so befall! 
        The world is gall 
Before the joys of life shall pall. 
If I've six stallions in my stall, 
The cohorts of Hell! 
From Heaven, across the World, to Hell! 
Betake thee to Hell! 
unsuspecting wanderer, and hang upon his shoulders when he fell! 
Why so fast and so fell? 
The young Queen in her crystal shell, 
Themselves, their holy value, and their spell! 
Why, here in dust, entice me with your spell, 
Pines, lest she hold as lost the man she loves so well! 
I hope we'll suit each other well; 
Then why not I, in mine, as well? 
If there he's led, they think, he'll follow them as well. 
Tis well. 
And none demanded: who got well? 
Peal rather there, where tender natures dwell. 
Farewell! 
 Ladies, farewell! 
My mother would--farewell! 
Farewell! 
With hair all bristling, it begins to swell. 
I feel his presence like something ill. 
Who has done me this ill? 
Snout of fly, mosquito-bill, 
Fly-snout and mosquito-bill, 
Fly-snout and mosquito-bill,-- 
A fine way, this, thy time to fill! 
Learn of the great and little world your fill, 
Now draw the stoppers, and drink your fill! 
So, take of traps and scenes your fill, 
The other, then, its place may fill. 
Come, let us mount this little hill; 
Ah, woe! thy lips are chill, 
Could I thy withered body kill, 
And on her neighbor try thy skill! 
     The lofty skill 
As he does in his dull old mill, 
But have a care that you nothing spill! 
Frog in green, and cricket-trill. 
Frog in grass, and cricket-trill,-- 
Frog in grass and cricket-trill, 
Summons thee hither to the door-sill, 
     Of Science, still 
Black as it seemed, I blackened still, 
And still. 
Thou pimp most infamous, be still! 
Yet we're eternally sterile still. 
'Tis struggling still! 
Sits unrestful still, 
Thou crav'st the same illusion still! 
The Doctor's in thy body still. 
Nay, but I will! 
Restrain thyself, thy sense and will 
Just as God will! 
Each tries his hand at what he will; 
Recall thy wandering will! 
And knows not what she should, or will; 
Let happen all that can or will! 
O beautiful fountain, that flows at will! 
We've washed, and are bright as ever you will, 
I know not what compels me to thy will: 
I've else, for all, a kindly will, 
And blacker yet was in my will; 
Fix and arrange it to my will; 
He'd show, at any rate, good-will,-- 
The cloth upon thy board bids smoothly thee unroll, 
In the pool! 
If her whims the wife control, 
As if you'd use, to get control, 
Which leads thee with its motherly control, 
That seemed to be a chain of pearl. 
To deck therewith my darling girl? 
He cried: "I find my conduct wholly hateful! 
To leave my wife, my trade, in manner so ungrateful! 
        Maidens disdainful 
Thou sweet, angelic soul! 
But that familiar harp with soul 
Pray'st thou for mercy on thy mother's soul, 
I feel, O maid! thy very soul 
     As doth the snail in shell, we crawl: 
Their clothes are colors that softly gleam. 
Give me thy hand! 'Tis not a dream! 
The last full wherry takes the stream. 
First children, and then work for bread to feed 'em,-- 
And little wings--we know 'em! 
How little now I deem, 
Thee, too!--'Tis thou! It scarcely true doth seem-- 
Now like contempt the crowd's applauses seem: 
So here she guessed, from every gem, 
And trees that daily with new leafage clothe them! 
From happy hours, and left me to deplore them. 
And names the Good, whose cheating fortune tore them 
And if no headache persecute them, 
     And they did not dare to brush them, 
     We crack them and we crush them, 
     We crack them and we crush them,

(_He takes hold of the fetters to unlock them_.) 
But tell me, pray, the proper means to gain them. 
I'll hang thereon with joy, and freely drain them; 
But, ah! in the streets I dare not bear them, 
Nor in the church be seen to wear them. 
I honor them. 
The bagpipe here unites them. 
To maim and slay delights them: 
With little wit, and ease to suit them, 
A title first must draw and interest them, 
Then, as a greeting, you are free to touch and test them, 
Such treasures have I, and can show them. 
Dissolved by the anthem! 
But yet, a little poem.

Saying: I believe in Him! 
And who profess Him, 
Who dare express Him? 
Which Jew and King may also claim. 
Is't not his heart's accord, urged outward far and dim, 
Yet, for the threshold's magic which controlled him, 
          Woes that molested him, 
          Trials that tested him, 
          Bliss hath invested him,-- 
          Balm, we arrayed him; 
          We tenderly laid him: 
With fairest images of dreams infold him, 
Not yet art thou the man, to catch the Fiend and hold him!-- 
          Linen to bind him 
  him: 
          Ah! when we would find him, 
(_All gather around him_) 
him, 
MARGARET (_flinging herself beside him_) 
     I'd know him and shame him. 
     And darest not name him? 
MARGARET (_throwing herself before him_) 
Fate such a bold, untrammelled spirit gave him, 
The dream of drink shall mock, but never lave him: 
Dragged through the wildest life, will I enslave him, 
Whose over-hasty impulse drave him 
With struggling, chilling, checking, so deprave him 
     Arches above him! 
        Praising and pleading him, 
        Brotherly feeding him, 
        Lovingly needing him, 
        Preaching and speeding him, 
    (_Clasping him_.) 
  (_Caressing him_.) 
To wind the world in unison with him? 
     Let it not fail him; 
     If your aid avail him, 
And willingly a glass I'll fill him. 
As well thou know'st, within an hour 'twill kill him. 
(_She turns away from him_.) 
What will you bet? There's still a chance to gain him, 
Gently upon _my_ road to train him! 
MARGARET (_turning to him_) 
And many draughts are known to him. 
        Ah, dared I clasp him, 
Come a hundred after him, 
(_She embraces him_.) 
God knows I loved, and can't forget him! 
And, truly, I did naught to fret him: 
Life somewhat better might content him, 
(_The People gather in a circle about him_.) 
And quickly fill the beaker to the brim! 
Give me a chair! I sink! my senses swim. 
_The dear old holy Roman realm, 
He said: "I had no time for play, for gaping freedom: 
To freedom. 
They scatter, devote and doom! 
        Break from your gloom! 
Room! and round about us, room! 
room! 
Who bids the storm to passion stir the bosom? 
     As if he had love in his bosom! 
     As if he had love in his bosom. 
     As if he had love in his bosom! 
     As if he had love in his bosom. 
     As if he had love in his bosom! 
     "As if he had love in his bosom!" 
Within thy bosom 
Who scatters every fairest April blossom 
I am so happy on thine arm, 
          And rested, panting, arm in arm,-- 
Thou soon shalt see, alive and warm. 
So free, so yielding, and so warm, 
          They first grew red, and then grew warm, 
A writhing worm, a terror-stricken form? 
Unwearied, for that fair and lovely form: 
How beautiful that woman-form! 
Dog! Abominable monster! Transform him, thou Infinite Spirit! transform 
  In the tides of Life, in Action's storm, 
(_He opens the Book, and perceives the sign of the Macrocosm_.) 
First, the _collegium logicum_. 
_Eritis sicut Deus, scientes bonum et malum_. 
So, Friend (my views to briefly sum), 
That nothing can be perfect unto Man 
What I can! 
Each one learns only--just what learn he can: 
He snuffles all he snuffle can: 
Go a-foot no more we can, 
I know too well that my poor gossip can 
You know the quality that can 
Then also take the finest can, 
Alternately follow, as best they can: 
And now before mine eyes expands the ocean 
Is like a beast on moorlands lean, 
Tis all so cramped and close and mean; 
I, image of the Godhead, who began-- 
        _(Sound of the organ_.) 
Each one's a fine musician! 
To the Devil, then, the curst musician! 
Without or gold or magic or physician. 
_Sans souci_, we call the clan 
If you've naught better, then, I'll tear your pretty plan! 
Ne'er entertain such an experienced man. 
Thou art a dear, good-hearted man, 
Decide the choice, and elevate the man. 
Restless activity proves the man! 
He is the proper man. 
Say, who's the stiff and pompous man? 
Now, there you are! O holy man! 
What means the gentleman? 
To change to my beloved German. 
The deepest gorges, faint and wan. 
Pardon the freedom I have ta'en,-- 
        Thou sorrow-laden, 
        Thou sorrow-laden, 
A parson came, by the mother bidden: 
    Wave, Undine, as bidden! 
     'Tis given unsought, unbidden! 
Stay never hidden. 
He saw, at once, where the game was hidden, 
    Sylph, be thou hidden! 
     From all men deeply hidden! 
        O Maiden! 
        Incline, O Maiden, 
Wherefore forsakest thou the lovely maiden, 
That you your heart with slander harden! 
And shows, no otherwise it could have been: 
Good Heaven! My mother can that have been? 
The third and fourth had never been. 
(_as they draw out the stoppers, and the wine which has been 
     Shine in meteor-sheen, 
From end to end, with labor keen; 
While all about lie pastures fresh and green. 
One sees no tree, no glimpse of green, 
I have no power o'er souls so green.

And yet, she's older than fourteen. 
Fairy king and fairy queen, 
     He ran into the kitchen, 
Were not the first and second, then 
Which, then? 
Behind the house, in my garden, then, 
Come in, then! 
And on our heads we go, then. 
Of merry creatures so, then; 
Who art thou, then? 
So that they gape in stupid wonder: then 
Whom then? 
And wax and leather keep the lordship then. 
My bosom thrills, with youthful passion shaken, 
Not been by me disturbed or shaken: 
It is so wretched, to be strange, forsaken, 
And I'd still be followed and taken! 
With all that I have undertaken, 
From magic airs that round your march awaken. 
A certain liquid was not drunken. 
Ravished and rapt from life, had sunken! 
                  Thrice must the words be spoken. 
Let not a word of moral law be spoken! 
The crowd is thronging, no word is spoken: 
     Thy doom is spoken! 
And knowledge brings disgust unspoken. 
The clock may stop, the hand be broken, 
     And will be broken. 
The death-bell tolls, the wand is broken. 
The thread of Thought at last is broken, 
At midnight is our compact broken. 
A knock? Come in! Again my quiet broken? 
Then let the death-bell chime the token. 
Each woman beautiful as Helen! 
     For the children of men, 
And are, at once, most popular of men. 
Fair greeting, gentlemen! 
This eve we'll expect the gentlemen. 
For with the people, as with women, 
The word, alas! dies even in the pen, 
     Heaven's own children 
        Christ is arisen, 
"The spirit-world no closures fasten; 
Disciple, up! untiring, hasten 
'Twas by a Dilettante written, 
All that there is in Earth and Heaven, 
Entreating from the Lord of Heaven! 
Ye gentle, powerful sounds of Heaven? 
When he is by, I could not pray to Heaven. 
Here is the People's proper Heaven; 
To change this hut into a lower heaven! 
To work, at once! The point which made me craven 
Is forward, on the ledge, engraven. 
I hear the noise of the village, even; 
That wheresoe'er he meets us, even, 
A new performance--'tis the last of seven. 
Yet strict attention must be given. 
Your messages I hear, but faith has not been given; 
O dearest hand, to thee 'tis given 
Have you not terms and definitions given 
The dear, good man! Long since was he forgiven. 
Is it the first time in your life you're driven 
Would of my wrong to her I might be shriven!" 
With tears, wrung hands and sighs, I've striven, 
Just treat, and let the landlord me arraign! 
Shoved to the block--they give the sign! 
(_He contemplates the sign_.) 
Was it a God, who traced this sign, 
How otherwise upon me works this sign! 
'Twas all deceit, and lying, false design! 
Not for a monarch's robe--the gift resign. 
         Come in! 
'Tis some strange gentleman.--Come in! 
My views, when next I venture in. 
Each bit of dung he seeks, to stick his nose in. 
By daylight even, they push and cram in

Then, the philosopher steps in 
the Spirit. A ruddy flame flashes: the Spirit appears in 
Would he still lay among the grass he grows in! 
On Sundays, holidays, there's naught I take delight in, 
        The sword Thy heart in, 
Are good to fish and sport in: 
Creative force, in cold disdain 
Quiet he lies, and grins disdain: 
Enamored hate, exhilarant disdain. 
That you may see how much I'd fain 
What is your business? I would fain-- 
Of Medicine I still would fain 
And heretofore to meet myself wert fain, 
What from the world have I to gain? 
See that you most profoundly gain 
And never shall I be glad again. 
And in thy lap wilt take me once again. 
We shall meet once again, 
      'Tis thou! O, say it once again! 
Release me, now! I soon shall come again; 
Since I behold Squire Satan here again! 
The dear, familiar phantoms rise again, 
Since Thou, O Lord, deign'st to approach again 
Don't let us hear that speech again! 
O, give me back my youth again! 
Will after noon return again. 
No,--no! I'll turn and go to town again. 
Get thou a set for her again! 
Whence, ever retreating, he sends again 
     The love of God revives again. 
             And soon to meet again! 
     Build it again, 
(_He places the casket in the press, and locks it again_.) 
But you in health came out again. 
The Devil can't get out again. 
Yet must I trouble you again. 
                          Hast played the spy again? 
The anguish of the dungeon, and the chain? 
Life tracks his devious, labyrinthine chain, 
     The deeds of passion cease to chain; 
Thou wilt unloose my chain, 
In belts across the green o' the plain. 
The Doctor has been catechised, 'tis plain; 
That's no great luck for me, 'tis plain. 
Did I not fear the landlord might complain, 
        Thou lookest up to where Thy Son is slain! 
One moment more I ask thee to remain, 
            Ah, can I not remain? 
With labor whimsical, and pain: 
The darling's sorrow gives me pain. 
The bliss that touched the verge of pain, 
Went into every house of pain: 
Confines it in this cave of pain! 
Not yet, it seems, have I given him pain. 
My brother! This is Hell's own pain! 
Further and satisfy your pain, 
        And bear aloft Thy sorrow and His pain! 
I take the wildering whirl, enjoyment's keenest pain, 
'Tis he! 'tis he! Where now is all my pain? 
        Thy gracious countenance upon my pain! 
        Incline Thy countenance upon my pain! 
     The fire-pain 
We've just retraced our way from. Spain, 
     Burn bone and brain! 
But then, the world--the human heart and brain! 
My father's was a sombre, brooding brain, 
What does not suit the human brain! 
Reason and sense forsake my brain, 
No fount of newer strength is in my brain: 
Woman, from such a name refrain! 
There's an old story has the same refrain; 
And all strike in at each refrain! 
I tell thee, from thy tears refrain! 
Thou shalt abstain--renounce--refrain! 
First Love returns, with Friendship in his train. 
I would I had a more cheerful strain! 
So that it be a bran-new strain! 
Take heed! 'Tis of the latest cut, my strain, 
But other aspects now obtain: 
You've made me roundly sweat, that's certain! 
The girls have much desire to ascertain 
        Help! rescue me from death and stain! 
Yes, of the kind which men attain! 
Of human thought and knowledge mine, in vain; 
For which I prayed. Not unto me in vain 
Whose wicked clench is all in vain! 
Are over--'tis all in vain! 
And snares the soul with visions vain; 
Then how shall we begin? 
We're here together, so begin! 
Queer Son of Chaos, to begin! 
Then pluck up heart, and give us sterling coin! 
Sense, Reason, Sentiment, and Passion join,-- 
All unprepared, the charm I spin: 
And now Death comes, and ruin! 
felon-comrade, who feeds on mischief and gluts himself with ruin? 
Thou canst not compass general ruin, 
        Calling to ruin. 
her increasing wretchedness, and suffered her to go helplessly to ruin! 
On! on! 
'Twas kissing and coddling, on and on! 
The flame they follow, on and on, 
My thoughts from torment, led me on, 
'Tis I! Come on! 
What's going on? 
I'll not forget while the world rolls on! 
And secretly the jewels don, 
Commend your soul to God for pardon, 
     They lured me so, I climbed thereon. 
There's blood thereon. 
That's not enough: we must believe thereon. 
And mother gave a loan thereon? 
     A tough old sow and the mother thereon, 
We'll have our private joy thereon. 
Would pain me in its wonted fashion. 
Let every marvel take form and fashion 
How changed in fashion 
Where Love and Friendship still divinely fashion 
Counsel in shrewd old-fashion! 
To find an opportune occasion. 
Scarce through a glass, by rare occasion, 
But win her by my own persuasion. 
How shall one lead it by persuasion? 
See I with precision? 
Midst of the wrathful, infernal derision, 
I knew the sweet sound of the voice of the vision! 
Of joyous days ye bring the blissful vision; 
My bosom burns with that sweet vision; 
Meets, to-night, my vision! 
In all the fullness of my vision 
With new impulsion 
My senses heave in this convulsion! 
For just where fails the comprehension, 
Of these one covets some slight apprehension. 
Of course! But only shun too over-sharp a tension, 
Hear them, to deeds and passion 
To quench the fervors of glowing passion! 
Too old am I to play with passion; 
The bonds that bless, the wreaths that crown his passion! 
Thy passion! 
She, there? She's coming from confession, 
'Tis long since thou hast been to mass or to confession. 
Waste not a day in vain digression: 
To walk with many a sweet digression,-- 
Why, therefore, yield to such depression? 
Seize every possible impression, 
Cursed be the lying dream's impression 
To play,--with grace and bold expression, 
Hear, of that girl I'd have possession! 
Desiring no possession 
And make it firmly your possession; 
Cursed, all that flatters as possession, 
The art bequeathed to his possession! 
One must, at least, make this admission-- 
He gave you, further, no commission? 
They seek the Evil One in wild confusion: 
     Where, in seclusion, 
But this is not of swift conclusion; 
     Lost in illusion. 
Leave to withdraw from my intrusion. 
Therein I've borne so much probation! 
Agreed! But 'tis a short probation. 
Here am I!--what mean perturbation 
If Poetry be your vocation, 
I use no lengthened invocation: 
About my bet I feel no trepidation. 
On insecure foundation. 
That ghosts can't stand on ordinary foundation? 
His path predestined through Creation 
Who, then, the changeless orders of creation 
Then range with all my senses through creation, 
Long is the calm brain active in creation; 
Sucks melancholy food from your creation; 
Of the qualities of his creation,-- 
A little freedom and recreation. 
With arts of mine afford thee recreation. 
As did a certain snake, my near relation. 
We pine and thirst for Revelation, 
Of youth collect, to hear the revelation! 
Have lent, in need and tribulation. 
The sun-orb sings, in emulation, 
Pardon, I heard your declamation; 
Now, give me of your taste some intimation. 
Who brings the One to join the general ordination, 
Give the rein to his imagination, 
Yet, truly, I've some inclination 
To leave them is my inclination. 
Aha! you lick your chops, from sheer anticipation. 
Come, walk at once! A rapid occupation 
In such an art I crave some preparation, 
Here rustles one that soon will work my liberation. 
Thou'rt shown to all the younger generation: 
Receive the people's honest veneration! 
You'll find it of peculiar operation. 
And dash out my brains in desperation! 
To view me is thine aspiration, 
A good man, through obscurest aspiration, 
What need to talk of Inspiration? 
Craving the speech of inspiration, 
Securely works his inspiration. 
Must start the needful perspiration, 
Had you not, long since, demonstration 
Will make a brilliant demonstration.

Come, draw thy circle, speak thine adjuration, 
O Sibyl excellent, enough of adjuration! 
If you would whirl in regular gyration 
Come, let me know your expectation 
If I fulfill my expectation, 
Takes from the People's moods no irritation; 
Time, only, strengthens the fine fermentation. 
And he deserves thy kitchen's best potation: 
But hither bring us thy potation, 
Especially if you heard and heeded his hortation. 
And serve thee in a social station; 
How lucky he, whose gifts his station 
And now!--I could tear my hair with vexation. 
It gives me great vexation; 
As from a corpse that breeds infection. 
'Tis very hard to shun the false direction; 
They feel, themselves, their resurrection: 
So like the medicine, it baffles your detection. 
From thee, thou jade! and seek protection 
From the bonds of Work, from Trade's restriction; 
Propel the high poetic function, 
So, these fine forces, in conjunction, 
So long I make no prohibition. 
Cursed be, at once, the high ambition 
Much do I know--but to know all is my ambition. 
And, like an old and half-extinct tradition, 
I have a friend of high condition, 
There hoe and dig, as thy condition; 
Three hundred masses buy, to save him from perdition! 
Such dilettants!--perdition! 
Rat-catching piper, thou!--perdition! 
Most zealously I seek for erudition: 
I crave the highest erudition; 
Cursed be the glare of apparition 
My thanks! I find the dead no acquisition, 
And fain would make my acquisition 
Who'll also add his deposition. 
Renewed is Pain: with mournful repetition 
My fairest luck finds no fruition: 
Who dares the child's true name in public mention? 
Hast thou, then, nothing more to mention? 
Com'st ever, thus, with ill intention? 
Would then no more impede my godlike motion; 
Give, unrestrained, the old emotion, 
I'd build a thousand bridges meanwhile, I've a notion. 
Canst thou thyself not brew the potion? 
The strength of Hate, Love's deep devotion,-- 
Has for ill-gotten goods the right digestion." 
The Church alone, beyond all question, 
Many enigmas there might find solution. 
It is a magic shape, a lifeless eidolon. 
And now, I do entreat this boon-- 
        Such is its boon! 
        Capitulate soon. 
We'll talk about the matter soon. 
Neighbor! your cordial! (_She falls in a swoon_.) 
Transform him again into his favorite likeness, that he may crawl upon 
'Tis thy mother's son! 
And we no less revere you for that reason: 
A red mouse from her mouth--sufficient reason. 
     So had I my reason. 
Who'd think of that in love's selected season? 
     Let me win in good season! 
We're only genuine children still, in Age's season! 
        Burst ye the prison, 
By such alone can we be won. 
The true witch-element we learn. 
The time I verily can discern 
O had I ne'er been born! 
Off! or you're lost ere morn. 
I burn! I burn! 
They shine, and spirt, and stink, and burn! 
When all the honest folk will turn 
Keep close! or we are parted, in our turn, 
Where would you get contemporary fun? 
And hast on smaller scale begun. 
Have you, perchance, elsewhere begun? 
        The coaxing shun 
Is't not soon enough when morning chime has run? 
The murderers, whither have they run? 
A dreary light, like that of dawn! 
The lip so red, the cheek's clear dawn, 
A faith bequeathed from Childhood's dawn, 
Perhaps 'twas brought by some one as a pawn, 
Let the thing be! All thence have evil drawn: 
No doubt you're right: no trace of mind, I own, 
And half and half thou art, I own. 
That were a charming sport, I own: 
        And hold, and own! 
Yet must be cared for, you will own. 
Ah, who may all this splendor own? 
Thou, monster, wilt nor see nor own 
And as for Faith and Church, I grant to each his own. 
Better the summit, I must own: 
Thee, boundless Nature, how make thee my own? 
With milk and water: 'twas my own.

Not that she needs so much to keep expenses down: 
THE HE-APE (_taking it down_)

If one some index could be shown, 
Patience must in the work be shown. 
What wouldst thou, then? She thinks that thou art flown; 
And see, that nothing can be known! 
And when a dozen thee have known, 
Medusa's tale to thee is known. 
Yes, for our household small has grown, 
But mother's sleep so light has grown, 
Still o'er my heart is that illusion thrown? 
Thou'rt also free to all the town. 
A house, a little garden near the town. 
A slave am I, whate'er I do-- 
O, no! As yet, it would not do. 
What's left undone to-day, To-morrow will not do. 
                  Good Sir, pray do! 
Thou goest away! O Henry, if I could go! 
Now, whither shall we go? 
To the lecture-hall you were forced to go,-- 
The door is open, art free to go. 
But I must go. 
Unto a neighbor she must go, 
And treasures, buried long ago: 
And thus the bitter task forego 
Up! holla! ho! 
Who? 
_pianissimo_ 
_Fortissimo_. 
No further step--no, no! 
Are known to me, and hated, too. 
My husband dead! Let me die, too! 
Take me, too! take me, too! 
I swear, with this condition, too, 
Yes, Neighbor! that's my notion, too: 
That, too! 
And this young lady will be present, too? 
In Nature and in Science too. 
Important matter, yet attractive too? 
Who overcometh, winneth too. 
But let us not, by such despondence, so 
The first was so, the second so, 
Why do ye stir the porridge so? 
Therefore the third and fourth are so; 
A rogue you are, and you were always so. 
All that is fine and good, to hear it so: 
The country's custom is not so. 
                        How so? 
  How so? 
How so? 
O no! my wish is great, my power is only so-so. 
Are you, perhaps, a virtuoso? 
the Apes, who are obliged to serve as reading-desk, and to 
(_drinks carelessly: the wine spills upon the earth, and turns to 
     Be sung thereto! 
Thou hast a perfect right thereto. 
Yet--all that drove my heart thereto, 
I'm mostly used, 'tis true, to go incognito, 
No! 
And all, belonging thereunto, 
If I mistake not, there are two. 
     In two! in two! 
(_They handle the crown awkwardly and break it into two 
Hemmed in by many a toppling heap 
Little step and lofty leap 
The mountain-chain, with all its gorges deep, 
possession of the key, and lead her forth with human hand! I will keep 
For zigzag courses we are wont to keep. 
With all its bays, in shining sleep! 
Which to the vaulted ceiling creep, 
Be kind enough to light us up the steep! 
You'll never mount the airy steep 
The crooked jump, the heavy skip, 
How each his legs in nimble trip 
From every precipice and thicket damp 
MARGARET (_with a lamp_) 
Away, thou pimp! 
     The stubble is yellow, and green the crop. 
     The witches ride to the Brocken's top, 
Swift from the North the spirit-fangs so sharp 
Then from the East they come, to dry and warp 
under foot! Not the first! O woe! woe which no human soul can grasp, 
Where is the breast, which from itself a world did bear, 
And she much love, much faith to him did bear, 
Yet this delusion in our hearts we bear: 
He takes thee for a lady, dear! 
        Kathrina dear, 
And all her crime was a delusion dear! 
Ah, God! another one so dear 
Enjoin upon him, as his head is dear, 
You've verily hit the truth! Leipzig to me is dear: 
          How many a one has fooled his dear, 
She'd take the Devil at his word, I fear. 
With such a servant danger comes, I fear. 
My head is nigh to split, I fear: 
I feel, I know not why, such fear!-- 
Thee, form of flame, shall I then fear? 
And waking, hear. 
It seems to me as if I hear 
That he the rattling chain, the rustling straw, can hear. 
The hearts and minds of all who hear. 
Of all things in the world! Just hear-- 
To most exactly measure, sew and shear, 
Speak thy conditions plain and clear! 
And, if we're light, we'll travel swift and clear: 
        In daybreak clear, 
She showed me mine, in crystal clear, 
Save from the soul it rises clear, 
They're of a noble house, that's very clear: 
I kept the baby's cradle near 
On! my shrinking but lingers Death more near. 
If I attempt to venture near, 
        Rapture creative near? 
        Save I have him near. 
For good things, oft, are not so near; 
        Thus is the Master near,-- 
Ye, Spirits, come--ye hover near-- 
The circle narrows: he is near! 
The morning twilight is near. 
She does not dream her lover listens near; 
If there be airy spirits near, 
From the marshes we appear, 
The circle of Creation will appear, 
Dim, as through gathering mist, her charms appear!-- 
And Dilettanti in the parts appear. 
A most fastidious person you appear. 
Haughty and discontented they appear. 
Yet with the flowing beard I wear, 
Thou, else, dost well the devil-nature wear: 
The form diviner beings wear! 
On highest holidays might wear! 
But first, at least this half a year, 
I'd mourn him decently a year, 
Believe me, who for many a thousand year 
A gallant youth! has travelled far: 
My love was near, but now he's far; 
Thou art, and thou remain'st, a sophist, liar.

With open throat sing chorus, drink and roar! 
Cursed be the vine's transcendent nectar,-- 
The touching of her lips, before the altar. 
She beckons, she nods not, her heavy head falls o'er; 
     Ah, when, within our narrow chamber 
        Within my lonely chamber 
     Flames in the breast each faded ember, 
Beasts, birds, trees, rocks, and all such lumber, 
The lovely land of wine, and song, and slumber. 
Have sung him truly into slumber: 
If you desire, a number. 
Squander the stars in any number, 
He sleeps! Enough, ye fays! your airy number 
To rate with gibes a scolder; 
I hope to see you moulder. 
     Salamander! 
Along this labyrinth of vales to wander, 
I must confess that forth I may not wander, 
You'll have him, when and where you wander: 
Yet thou canst often this way wander, 
How would I for the fault atonement render! 
For love, my blood and life would I surrender, 
Prone at her feet, relaxed and tender! 
I rub my hands, in expectation tender-- 
Leave that, my child! Thou know'st my love is tender; 
Her thoughts and yearnings seek thee, tenderer, fonder,-- 
                 He seems of her still fonder. 
I'll hear no more: 'tis vain to ponder 
Or, in the spheres we dream of yonder, 
Walk up and down an hour, before the mirror yonder,-- 
The window's here, the door is yonder; 
We'll surely find him by those poplars yonder. 
Then climb the rocky ramparts yonder, 
Out yonder? 
                 Flown up the alley yonder, 
Enough of that! Thy love sits lonely yonder, 
The threshold under, 
Hell heaves in thunder! 
The tree-trunks terribly thunder, 
The roots are twisting asunder! 
How roars the orgy louder! 
But only two wear powder. 
The finest lasses and the best of beer, 
Come up to Burgdorf? There you'll find good cheer, 
     And the new songs of cheer 
The beverage may work the proper cheer. 
At home I've neither rest nor cheer, 
Yet drinks their wines with hearty cheer. 
I seek him everywhere, I pry and peer, 
     Into the depths of Nature peer,-- 
Yes, I am Faust: I am thy peer! 
     Bid the new career 
I gratulate thee on thy new career! 
The bet I offer. 
The pure, their hands to offer, 
You well deserve a speedy marriage-offer: 
Surely for his soul's sake full many a prayer I'll proffer. 
Contentment flows from out my breast no longer. 
But ah! I feel, though will thereto be stronger, 
Thou hast therewith so filled and drowned her, 
So that by wish and will you bend her; 
First came thy passion's flood and poured around her 
What! I delay to free her? 
I dread, once again to see her? 
Poor Margaret flatter, and ensnare her, 
I'll yet detect thy sweetheart and ensnare her, 
Her life, in fact, they're loath to spare her. 
And the man berate her, 
Take me thither, I say, and liberate her! 
Thou'lt hear much more before we leave her. 
Grateful for gifts the Holy Christmas gave her, 
She took all the presents the fellow gave her. 
Yes, sing away, sing on, and praise, and brag of her! 
MARTHA (_adorning her_) 
     The queen she got them upon her, 
MEPHISTOPHELES (_aside to her_) 
Some day, as bridegroom, home to bear her. 
And all thy soul's devotion swear her?

And shall I see--possess her? 
(MARGARET _comes in, conceals herself behind the door, puts her 
Presents at once? That's good: he's certain to get at her! 
The surer, afterwards, to cheat her. 
Should his good-night in lustful gallop bleat her! 
Where four roads cross, in wanton play to meet her: 
A secret dread began to haunt her. 
Thou fool, go in and comfort her! 
And if we were discovered by her, 
I've often heard it said, a preacher 
I do not pretend I could be a teacher 
Might learn, with a comedian for a teacher. 
'Tis enough: ascend no higher,-- 
        Thou seest the Father; 
Dost recognize no more the tall cock's-feather? 
But see, what motley flames among the heather! 
     Through the moss and through the heather! 
Must tell my name, old face of leather? 
     Loveliest weather, 
Hung here, around this throne, where sat the father! 
A nice estate was left us by my father, 
The shadows thus within my bosom gather. 
Departed joy and pain wert wont to gather! 
        Thy sad sighs gather, 
     And in wildering escort gather! 
Well, we'll consider: thou canst gather

When _There_ again we come together, 
There's both together! 
Yet, though I thresh them all together, 
That binds the Noble and Mean together. 
Where boon companions meet together, 
Unseen the threads are knit together. 
Just as we meant to hold them fast together.

Old gentlemen, why at the outskirts? Enter! 
To swallow up each ranter,

Then through the safest gate you'll enter 
There is, to make thee young, a simpler mode and apter; 
And is a most eccentric chapter. 
Know'st thou, at last, thy Lord and Master? 
Lay thyself at the feet of the Master! 
Seest thou the spiral circles, narrowing faster, 
Mist-like melting, ever faster. 
Since he's installed, his arrogance grows faster. 
Why, for a poodle who has lost his master, 
He suits me not at all, our new-made Burgomaster! 
Thee and thy monkey-sprites with fell disaster? 
That, too, from thee? Murder and death of a world upon thee, monster!

Poison for such poor rats to scatter. 
They whirl and whistle, pull and chatter! 
If he can't every step bechatter, 
They crowd and push, they roar and clatter! 
     Islands, that flatter, 
I know how one the People's taste may flatter, 
When others dance, he weighs the matter: 
All ages have been taught the matter,-- 
How the dull fools enjoy the matter! 
What they're accustomed to, is no great matter, 
The fortune of this hour embitter! 
The green-embosomed houses glitter! 
I meant to say, were you not touched in earnest, ever? 
Here lieth one who loves thee ever, 
No sacrifice shall he repent of ever. 
And her head is wagging ever. 
She talks like one who raves in fever.

If he had only been as clever, 
A face like thine beheld I never. 
Live with the like of him, may I never! 
Clasp you in bonds of love, relaxing never, 
One should allow one's self to jest with ladies never. 
And what one knows, one uses never. 
Thou dar'st not tell the youngsters--never! 
And spare my lungs henceforth: whoever 
Canst thou, poor Devil, give me whatsoever? 
Will serve thee at once and forever 
Fix in its place with thoughts that stand forever! 
The hope, from Error's deeps to rise forever! 
        Then fell his eyelids forever, 
Why plague thyself with threshing straw forever? 
The thraldom of thy woe to sever. 
Fear not that I this pact shall seek to sever? 
Well, well! That might have done, however, 
There must be such queer birds, however. 
And weak old Winter himself must shiver, 
I feel an icy shiver! 
I would myself unto the Devil deliver, 
Who would himself therefrom deliver? 
Released from ice are brook and river 
     Under and over, 
The days of that old Northern phantom now are over: 
     Follows them over. 
        His eyes with tears ran over, 
Float in thy twilight the meadows over, 
His prey to discover! 
Where canst thou horns and tail and claws discover? 
And yet, somehow, his face I can't discover. 
     Back and forth hover, 
     Hoo-hoo! Shoo-hoo! Nearer hover 
With spirits through mountain-caverns hover, 
blood, from thy hand, still lies upon the town! Avenging spirits hover 
     Pass as they hover; 
That was the voice of my lover! 
With several wild young blades, a soldier-lover: 
     Jay and screech-owl, and the plover,-- 
But come! we'll go from this fire to a newer: 
     Landscape and bower, 
     Bower on bower! 
The purest bliss was surely then thy dower. 
     Lo! in a shower 
Thine own ecstatic life on all things shower, 
daren't say how--to pluck the final flower! 
Then, at your play, behold the fairest flower 
I will convey thee there; and hear, what I can do! Have I all the power 
Who, headsman! unto thee such power 
And I? What drew me here with power? 
Each tender soul, with sentimental power, 
From these the angels draw their power, 
my power. 
To taste, I know not what, in haughty power, 
O would that I, before that spirit-power, 
She snuffs within her book of prayer, 
Crush me!--Air! 
Keen scent has she for tainted air; 
How raves the tempest through the air! 
     False word and form of air, 
One has at once another air. 
I only seize, with sketchy air, 
A will-o'-the-wisp in murky air. 
The tender bosom filled and fair, 
Alone and far, a girl most pale and fair? 
Blest he, whose bosom Truth makes pure and fair! 
Such things? Never beheld I aught so fair! 
"Ah, still delay--thou art so fair!" 
I'm neither lady, neither fair, 
By Heaven, the girl is wondrous fair! 
                   That is not fair! 
(_plaiting and binding up the braids of her hair_) 
The splendid sole adornment of her hair! 
How would the pearl-chain suit my hair? 
Eternal!--for the end would be despair. 
As is a devil in despair.

And over plains and lakes and islands

Why such a noise? What are my lord's commands? 
thou art calmly grinning at the fate of thousands! 
You have it now! he understands. 
Such a reproach not in the least offends; 
What he never comprehends, 
One at the window sits, with glass and friends, 
To Him above bow down, my friends,

And the Good and the Beautiful vilipends, 
Who teaches help, and succor sends! 
To gold still tends, 
A man who some result intends

The choice is free: make up your minds.

The wilful summer-birds! 
Draw near, and view your patrons' faces! 
     Trees and rocks with grinning faces, 
Reel off a host of threads before their faces, 
They turn their faces, 
What dreams are yours in high poetic places? 
     See them swiftly changing places, 
     Down the high places, 
All times I'll have to think on you, all places! 
The same thing, in all places, 
But you have friends in other places, 
Are anything but pleasant places. 
He walks with haughty paces: 
I find these walls, these vaulted spaces 
     With crystalline spaces, 
Into the high ancestral spaces. 
     In the vast, the desert spaces! 
     And the winged races 
And clinging lust the world in its embraces; 
     In happy embraces, 
By sheer diffuseness you have won their graces, 
That meekness, lowliness, the highest graces 
"He scents the Jesuits' traces." 
The botching work each fine pretender traces 
When thou hast dashed this world to pieces, 
More speech than any tongue suffices 
No earthly meat or drink the fool suffices: 
And, when it finds an angle-worm, rejoices! 
I've had, myself, at times, some odd caprices, 
But mind, allow the tailor no caprices: 
Yet now I curse whate'er entices 
I craved, to censure others' vices. 
Forsooth! He serves you after strange devices: 
With dazzling cheats and dear devices 
But not at the dances! 
Whom, after rapid, maddening dances, 
You press and count the pulse's dances, 
The meteor that a moment dances,-- 
Woe for my garland! The chances 
Then, worthy Sir, improve betimes your chances! 
Could he but try the lottery's chances! 
How would the ape be sure his luck enhances. 
And then, with burning sidelong glances, 
Beckons my neighbor with her wanton glances, 
Let us, then, use a Jack-o'-lantern's glances: 
O fortunate, for whom, when victory glances, 
And lights so dimly, that, as one advances, 
I dread to see how such a fate advances. 
Get thee away with thine offences,

Her simple, homely life commences, 
My friend, thou'lt win, past all pretences, 
It dwarfed and withered all my soul's pretences! 
He cannot change external forces. 
And when from these my life itself divorces, 
Can deeply stir the inner sources; 
Here, on this earth, my pleasures have their sources; 
Why, tell me now, thou Son of Hades, 
Itself detaches, spreads and fades. 
All movement of my life impedes? 
Wherewith the mind itself deludes! 
That on the finer sense intrudes!

Misfortune tames him by degrees; 
His own most natural form he sees. 
That's better, now! The How and Where, one sees.

And over the wreck-strewn gorges 
The tempest whistles and surges!

They whirl in narrow, circling trails, 
Like kittens playing with their tails? 
Of doubts or critic-cavils: 
Or how should there be devils? 
To overcome the poets and the devils. 
Around my head!--There falls 
Who, scorning all external gleams, 
And what in wavering apparition gleams 
     Here bright it gleams, 
     Here brighter seems: 
A question small, it seems, 
Receive me, thou, that in thine open arms 
How oft the children, with their ruddy charms, 
These are the musicians! 
Their everlasting aches and groans, 
And stirreth not and quickens 
Than all the lore of wisest brains. 
Where even the welcome daylight strains 
A blessing drawn from supernatural fountains! 
In night and dew to lie upon the mountains; 
A look from thee, a word, more entertains 
(_He lifts one of the bed-curtains_.) 
Sun, moon, and all the starry legions, 
I venture not to soar to yonder regions 
So, here, we keep our good old fashions! 
Shows through the glass from Magic's fair dominions! 
O lend me, Love, the swiftest of thy pinions, 
     Voices of those heavenly visions? 
Why, let them break their heads, let loose their passions, 
     And also all his relations 
Say, who would put his trust in nations, 
     He had the first of stations, 
     And the echoes, like traditions 
And kin of all conditions, 
     Hear I tender love-petitions? 
        My bosom yearns 
Perhaps. 
Get me something the angel keeps! 
Lead me thither where she sleeps! 
And stealthy, then, along the coping creeps: 
(_She weeps_.) 
That round the tall fire-ladders sweeps, 
Over her head and ears; 
     Grapes the vine-stem bears, 
And as a token with him bears, 
Man usually believes, if only words he hears, 
When Shame is born and first appears, 
(_Disappears_.) 
Now, wept beyond her tears; 
     Horns the he-goat wears! 
The garment of Life which the Deity wears! 
I'm climbing now three hundred years, 
We're cooking watery soup for beggars.

The poising eagle slowly soars, 
Friendly, the everlasting stars?

Woe! woe! They come. O death of bitterness! 
And then, as one a child's tooth draws, with cleverness, 
Where, how, and when he died, to certify his fitness. 
I'd like to have a legal witness, 
Is oft mere vanity and narrowness. 
Will best, on Sundays, fondle and caress. 
  So red of cheek and fine of dress, 
Quick! lest our game escape us in the press: 
     And far and wide the heather press 
Then may delight and distress, 
  And see and lighten my distress! 
Art thou a man, then pity my distress! 
What fresh and vital forces, canst thou guess, 
Who are the strangers, should you guess? 
(_clasping him, and returning the kiss_) 
Once Heavenly Love sent down a burning kiss 
        And, ah! his kiss! 
And it seems thou repellest my kiss: 
        Of his talk, the bliss 
I feel a youthful, holy, vital bliss 
That was a sweet and a gracious bliss, 
And prayer dissolved me in a fervent bliss. 
        Master, Thy bliss! 
        Followers, Him we miss; 
        Lads, let the trumpets 
But tell me now, ye cursed puppets, 
A girl in Sunday clothes,--these three are my delights. 
Would I were free from the thoughts 
     And everything fits, 
     If lucky our hits, 
No mastery he inherits 
And grant to these their merits, 
Therein thou'rt free, according to thy merits; 
Over the Spirits. 
Of all the bold, denying Spirits, 
Infer the better spirits. 
FROSCH _sits_) 
Woe's me! I fear to lose my wits. 
These are the small dependants

     The child is stifled, the mother bursts. 
     The broom it scratches, the fork it thrusts, 
And yet, this want may be supplied us; 
O let us kneel, and call the Saints to hide us! 
Under the steps beside us, 
We call the Supernatural to guide us; 
A little burning air, which I shall soon prepare us, 
Nor would I beg the bird his wing to spare us: 
What nonsense she declaims before us! 
Now I'll tell thee the graves to give us: 
No, no! Thou must outlive us. 
Arches not there the sky above us? 
And now you even dance, like one of us! 
Why must the stream so soon run dry and fail us, 
And burning thirst again assail us? 
And such a luck from Heaven befell us, 
Yet something is required from us. 
Use well your time! It flies so swiftly from us; 
     The love of Man revives within us, 
     The wild desires no longer win us, 
And play your hocus-pocus on us! 
Don't try that game a second time upon us! 
dizziness? Did we thrust ourselves upon thee, or thou thyself upon us? 
     Who sneaks to us? 
How otherwise the mental raptures bear us 
Above the earth will nimbly bear us, 
Superbly from the arches o'er us. 
Come on, and none shall pass us! 
Gladly obey, because they gladly cheat us; 
And lisp like angels, when with lies they meet us. 
     Incubus! Incubus! 
And then the lofty instinct, thus-- 
What a spectre I've harbored thus! 
The soulless sneak disturbs me thus! 
Ye gentlemen, don't pass me thus! 
Accurséd folk! How dare you venture thus?

Again it seethes, again it glows! 
Where each to each his brag allows, 
Its exhalation tracks and follows 
How strangely glimmers through the hollows

The apparition was so giant-great, 
Go! go! I never will retreat. 
(_as_ MEPHISTOPHELES _approaches his seat_) 
What? 
A tall cock's-feather in my hat, 
But who is that? 
                      Dost pity her, at that? 
Then parry that! 
And I advise thee, brief and flat, 
Dances so many a festive boat; 
Powder becomes, like petticoat, 
So I sit naked on my goat, 
Comes up with soothing light, around me float 
Whence the glad tidings hither float; 
And, strange! around her fairest throat 
When one of us at spinning sat, 
This time, I'll let thee 'scape the debt; 
She's played the fool at last, there's not a doubt. 
The cooking, early work and late, in fact; 
Is so exact! 
And each goes home content with the effect, 
Will finally, himself, his bit select: 
Yes, for the pious, I suspect, 
And on the Blocksberg they erect 
You'll always have them at your feet. 
Sweet pain of love, bind thou with fetters fleet 
At Neighbor Martha's you'll this evening meet. 
Here is a casket, not unmeet, 
And if your acts are half discreet, 
O welcome, twilight soft and sweet, 
in Heaven and on Earth? I will becloud the jailer's senses: get 
Just think, the pocket of a priest should get 
A gift for her I bid thee get! 
May it agree with you, what you get! 
When peace we crave and more luxurious diet. 
Kindly content with any diet. 
And could not even eat my share in peace and quiet!" 
Behind the stove repose thee in quiet! 
When on an idler's bed I stretch myself in quiet. 
Here will we house ourselves in quiet.

MARGARET (_hiding herself on the pallet_) 
MEPHISTOPHELES (_takes the gimlet_) 
     My father, the varlet, 
For since we two together met, 
This miracle alone can work the Poet 
Go, league thyself with a poet, 
Margaret! Margaret! 
HOW otherwise was it, Margaret, 
Margaret! 
And Margaret? 
Tell no one thou has been with Margaret! 
The trinkets left for Margaret! 
Still weaving its eternal secret, 
An offal-barrel and a lumber-garret, 
        For thee these flowers I set. 
That which to Naught is in resistance set,-- 
Where God His human creature set, 
For you no bound, no term is set. 
A knave sharp-set! 
        He sat at the royal banquet 
        Alas! my tears did wet, 
Thy dear, dear hand!--But, ah, 'tis wet! 
And bones of beasts surround me yet! 
Just wait awhile: I'll have him yet. 
The Something of this clumsy world,--has yet, 
Why, wipe it off! Methinks that yet 
'Tis too early yet. 
Live with the ox as ox, and think it not a theft 
     Woman in thousand steps is theft. 
That, trust me, is the best mode left, 
Yet he who grasps the Moment's gift, 
But do church-penance in her sinner's shift! 
So now her head no more she'll lift, 
In vain that through the realms of science you may drift; 
Air? Light? 
Part of the Darkness which brought forth the Light, 
Fire, water, darkness, Day and Night! 
And _you_ he dowers with Day and Night. 
Part of the Part am I, once All, in primal Night,-- 
'Tis true, she showed me, on Saint Andrew's Night, 
Forerunning the grand Walpurgis-Night: 
We climb the Brocken's top in the Walpurgis-Night, 
     'Tis finished straight! 
Now, in the Devil's name, go straight, 
Address him, and he gambols straight; 
He lays for us the pillows straight! 
Spirit of Contradiction! On! I'll follow straight. 
     Make seven and eight, 
I am no hair's-breadth more in height, 
Turn thee about, and from this height 
They swear and storm, they yell and fight! 
I think the Devil must fight! 
I'm Magister--yea, Doctor--hight, 
Quick, bring a light! 
The more she seeks the day's broad light. 
Be sure to have thy luggage light. 
The Spirit aids me: now I see the light! 
Father had died before it saw the light, 
In motley pictures little light, 
All come forth to the cheerful light. 
     The better soul awakes to light. 
She is in secret brought to light, 
The moon conceals her light-- 
                 Why not? 'tis light. 
Use both the great and lesser heavenly light,-- 
     Then lower, and on the ground alight; 
And if that image of delight 
But more on him who gave her such delight. 
And one keeps watch then with delight. 
I would have shared your watches with delight, 
(_plucking the last leaf, she cries with frank delight_:) 
Is made but for a God's delight! 
But only, on so bold a flight, 
          Then round the circle went their flight, 
     When round the summit whirls our flight, 
That round and round some fiend misleads to evil plight, 
Thy business thus to slight: 
The loss of thee were truly very slight,-- 
Now am I wholly in thy might. 
     I leave in deep, prophetic night, 
Thinks on the jewels, day and night, 
My work and worry, day and night? 
One has one's hands full all the day and night; 
From the churches' solemn and reverend night, 
I pray you, Friend, 'tis now the dead of night; 
And then they draw the veil of night 
I blissed it all this livelong night; 
His palace for this festal night? 
     Or scratch them, day or night: 
     Who cannot raise himself to-night 
Rest not within mine arms to-night, 
And the heaviest weight to-night 
Well, well,--to-night--? 
And yet I'm right! 
          They danced to left, they danced to right: 
And straight or cross-wise, wrong or right, 
If what one does, or leaves undone, is right, 
I claim, I tell thee, all my right; 
'Tis planned most wisely, if I judge aright: 
Your mind will shortly be set aright, 
Why, be one then, outright! 
And now they say I killed the child outright. 
'Tis lucky thou hast seen the sight; 
But _us_ he thrusts in darkness, out of sight, 
But now, leave jesting out of sight! 
The uglier she is to sight, 
Come, Agatha! I shun the witch's sight 
Back on the town direct thy sight. 
And, worst of all, full many a wight 
     Is evermore a ruined wight. 
I say to thee, a speculative wight 
     Some one, within, is caught! 
As in Italian tales 'tis taught. 
If by the Spirit I am truly taught. 
Then thus: "In the Beginning was the _Thought_" 
'Twill plod along the path of thought, 
And temper the austere delight of thought. 
     Who takes no thought, 
And knead and shape her to your thought, 
We mark how, ere our times, a sage has thought, 
Where tends thy thought? 
And then, how far his work, and grandly, we have brought. 
And thus, to graver paces brought, 
     To him 'tis brought, 
Ah, thought I, in my conduct has he read it-- 
     Yet,-----as 'twas, I fancied it. 
        I never shall find it, 
        I never shall find it, 
        I never shall find it, 
With the police 'twere easy to compound it, 
But here the penal court will sift and sound it.

And yet the Devil cannot make it.

If 'twould, my love, would I advise it? 
If thine, or whose? 'tis needless to debate it. 
And otherwise must I translate it. 
The _Word?_--impossible so high to rate it; 
We shall be made to dearly rue it. 
Who bade them so construe it? 
Save it! Save it! 
A hash, a stew, will bring success, believe it! 
Your hearers pick and pluck, as soon as they receive it! 
I have no name to give it! 
If you've a piece, why, just in pieces give it: 
My well-apportioned share of it."

I have a mind to open it. 
I'll find her room to-day, and take you in it. 
I would force myself on thee and constrain it, 
But no more, no more can I attain it! 
Say, how? Say, where? If buried, did he own it? 
Who knows, now, whither the four winds have blown it? 
I know not, should I do it? 
No need to tell me twice to do it! 
They sing songs about me! 'tis bad of the folk to do it! 
Kiss me!--canst no longer do it? 
So, oftentimes, you miserably mar it! 
dungeon as a criminal, and given up to fearful torments! To this has it 
It will not harm her, when one tries it? 
That's well, indeed! For painful is it 
What work I do,--how hard and steady is it! 
And I must nurse it, warm beside me press it, 
My bed at night: if 't even stirred, I'd guess it, 
Don't incommode yourself! How could you ever kiss it! 
Is open left--the lines don't fit it. 
Well,--Chance, this time, has fairly hit it! 
No, greet my sweetheart not! I tell you, I'll resent it. 
My sweetheart greet and kiss! I dare you to prevent it! 
Then wear the crown, and show it, 
And all you find, be sure to show it! 
On men so various: now, my friend, pray show it. 
Yet will I know it. 
Upon our German stage, you know it, 
Before the Mother of God we'll lay it; 
With heavenly manna she'll repay it!" 
Demeans himself, and shames me by it; 
That you might win another by it. 
To take the spade in hand, and ply it. 
I swear, 'twill turn her head, to spy it: 
I am not used to that; I cannot stoop to try it--

What dazzles, for the Moment spends its spirit: 
Couldst thou but read, within mine inmost spirit, 
        At the pane I sit; 
To bring no gift when her I visit. 
        The house I quit. 
The Garter does not deck my suit, 
I must, perforce, look up the matter. _[Exit_.

     All for the distant 
Though our acquaintance is so recent, 
When thou, still innocent, 
Here gush the sparkles incandescent 
     And drop, quiescent? 
The words you've bandied are sufficient; 
In compliments you're both proficient, 
But for the gleam of heavenly light which Thou hast lent 
Destruction,--aught with Evil blent,-- 
A chain at first, then other ornament: 
Than here, in our New Testament. 
That is my proper element. 
Be quiet, friendly element! 
Whom wilt thou lure? God's-element!

You'll know us, to your detriment. 
That even each joy's presentiment 
Demand'st thou, Pedant, too, a document? 
To the Devil, first, the instrument! 
Thus in desire I hasten to enjoyment, 
What bliss within this narrow den is pent! 
Serpent! Serpent! 
Help! Fire! Help! Hell-fire is sent! 
Which nowhere worthier is, more nobly sent, 
What use, a Whole compactly to present? 
Thou hast the moral right to cry me "shame!" at present. 
But, see! in all their height, at present, 
     I live at present! 
Might I, perhaps, depart at present? 
Hast never known a man, nor proved his word's intent? 
Of quiet, order, and content! 
If such your taste, and be content;

Save your own heart is eloquent! 
With grinning masks of life prevent 
Thy mother will not see, and stories we'll invent. 
'Tis easily displayed, and easy to invent.

Leave to the multitude their riot!

Thou angel, fear it not! 
     The fool knows it not! 
Then thou believest not! 
And you, Sir, travel always, do you not? 
Loves me--not--loves me--not-- 
But honored and at home is here the cloven foot. 
     Unto the knight with cloven foot! 
Yet I perceive no cloven foot; 
FAUST (_stamping his foot_) 
     He knows not the pot, 
And what's this pot? 
With what a pang one leaves so many a spot, 
'Twould be my death upon the spot! 
What does he want in this holy spot? 
Show me the fruits that, ere they're gathered, rot, 
And when thou in the feeling wholly blessed art, 
I'll play the comedy with art. 
To me it is a proper art 
We'll spread this cloak with proper art, 
  Sweet innocent, thou art! 
                  Ah, rogue! a tease thou art: 
My Margaret, see! still young thou art, 
Foreboding angel that thou art! 
Why, on the whole, thou'rt--what thou art. 
And thou remainest--what thou art. 
To see him now I have no heart. 
With paragraphs all got by heart, 
And thy heart 
Vast as it is, fill with that force thy heart, 
Something beneath thy heart, 
And do I ask, wherefore my heart 
And from my heart. 
             Dearest man! I love thee from my heart. 
And in his presence stifled seems my heart. 
It stabbed me to the very heart. 
My very heart

But not the least bit shrewd or smart,

Perhaps you'll warmly take their part? 
Prepare beforehand for your part 
What am I, then, if 'tis denied my part 
He must not unconsoled depart. 
When thou from honor didst depart 
How shall we leave the house, and start? 
Now where, just tell me, is there better sport? 
They dance, they chat, they cook, they drink, they court: 
Not only cold, amazed acquaintance yield'st, 
Here to the altar cam'st, 
Thine earthly self behind thee cast, 
I have not snares around thee cast; 
Even all the misery on him cast 
              A beast! 
First, to encounter the beast, 
Inspect him close: for what tak'st thou the beast? 
Impertinent beast! 
'Tis the absurdest, drollest beast. 
To be far beastlier than any beast. 
Long since: yet deemed him not important in the least. 
Come, follow us! Come here, at least! 
Take the brush here, at least, 
You'll let me triumph with a swelling breast: 
With brazen forehead, daring breast? 
Get me a kerchief from her breast,-- 
mighty love is in her breast. 
How fares the heart within your breast? 
Leaps, maddened, into the abyss's breast! 
Fails to subdue the tumult of his breast. 
     A cross upon his breast. 
But grantest, that in her profoundest breast 
Gulps the wild Moment in its greedy breast; 
Why is my heart so anxious, on thy breast? 
That, like a vulture, feeds upon thy breast! 
A maid that, even from my breast, 
Then show'st me mine own self, and in my breast 
Two souls, alas! reside within my breast, 
Who traps the Devil, hold him fast! 
come! to this!--Treacherous, contemptible spirit, and thou hast 
But see! He's dead therefrom, at last. 
at last,-- 
They will even say, at last, 
The shameless murderers praised at last! 
Nay, sheathe thy sword at last! 
One step, and thou art free at last! 
O yes, up to the stars at last! 
And elbows planted as in boast: 
With brimming glass that spilled the toast, 
O, let the past be past! 
Listen, my friend: the ages that are past 
The silvery phantoms of the ages past, 
From Earth the highest raptures and the best, 
One impulse art thou conscious of, at best; 
Thou'rt like the Spirit which thou comprehendest, 
Gossip! the times thou badly comprehendest: 
'Twere better if for novelties thou sendest: 
Thou, who around the wide world wendest, 
Among Thy menials, now, my face Thou findest. 
And ask us how we do, in manner kindest, 
Hear, hear! A flea! D'ye rightly take the jest? 
The gentleman is pleased to jest. 
Death is desired, and Life a thing unblest! 
To thee, of all earth's sons the poorest, dullest! 
Around me here, of spirit-presence fullest? 
     There was a rat in the cellar-nest, 
And if thou'rt moved to speak in earnest, 
Thou darest not tell me so in earnest. 
What need, that after words thou yearnest? 
To plague my day auspicious thou returnest. 
That thou manur'st the acre which thou reapest;-- 
Whereby for eighty years thy youth thou keepest! 
Thou art a man among the rest. 
As here of Schwerdtlein's death and place of rest? 
From here to eternal rest: 
Take hold, then! let reflection rest, 
The monster without air or rest, 
And now, away! Thou dar'st not rest. 
From ashy rest 
The day dawns: Dearest! Dearest! 
Amused us hast, on the mountain's crest, 
     He now was wholly drest-- 
Half conscious of his frenzied, crazed unrest, 
With all you gentlemen, the name's a test, 
I am not one of the greatest, 
Thee into the mob thou hatest! 
Brides only, and the sweetest! 
And prospects the completest! 
A welcome, but also a silent, guest. 
And yet is never Death a wholly welcome guest. 
I call a flea a tidy guest. 
     He had a paunch beneath his vest 
          In ribbons, wreath, and gayest vest 
So fain I stay, when thou delayest! 
If longer here thou stayest, 
Dust shall he eat, and with a zest, 
And Honor's godlike zest, 
And plunge into the world with zest! 
     With powerful fist: 
The time is long: thou need'st not now insist. 
"For God's sake," others to assist. 
No--no! The Devil is an egotist, 
thou canst not carry it out? Wilt fly, and art not secure against 
To reach the seller's box, a fighting host, 
        My thought is lost, 
To get a ticket break their necks almost. 
SECOND STUDENT (_to the First_) 
She is not the first. 
The Doctor Faust? 
Know'st Faust? 
Of books worm-eaten, gray with dust, 
And strike them into dust! 
  disgust, 
Then I suggest, 'twere fair and just 
To spare the lovely day your lust, 
You'll then work on, because you must. 
  must. 
Had not enough, to thrust 
But 'tis not meant to thrust 
Against the smoky paper thrust,-- 
You are not miserly, I trust? 
With resolute, courageous trust 
Yet, wilt thou to me entrust 
No, not a word. I go so little out. 
Come out! Come out! 
     And he'll work himself out. 
MARGARET (_coming out_) 
By the chimney out! 
        He drained it at every bout: 
Off and about, 
MEPHISTOPHELES (_prying about_) 
     Take heed--look about! 
     He ran around, he ran about, 
        As oft as he drank thereout. 
     He gnawed and scratched the house throughout. 
     To leave the kettle, and singe the Frau! 
          Adieu! 
With power to feel and to enjoy it. Thou 
Ha! know'st thou me? Abomination, thou! 
her? Who was it that plunged her into ruin? I, or thou? 
E'er understood by such as thou? 
Where art thou? 
The restless, ruddy gold hast thou, 
     Knowest and fearest thou 
     Base Being, hearest thou? 
What murmurest thou? 
With what a feeling, thou great man, must thou 
Broomstick, you! 
As warmer life in every limb had crowned you; 
Fair lady, let it not offend you, 
That arm and escort I would lend you! 
All Heaven descends, and opens bright around you! 
And you? 
But something new must then requite you. 
With what a vintage can I serve you? 
Sir Doctor, it is good of you, 
It but depends upon the like of you, 
Allow me that my album first I reach you,-- 
Grant me this favor, I beseech you! 
Is, I perceive, a principle with you. 
That I could not be angrier with you. 
I would, myself, change rings with you. 
Your lungs, till breath and being fail you: 
Sweep down, and with their barbéd points assail you; 
Tokay shall flow at once, to fill you! 
Fill up my glass with sweetest, will you? 
At once confide all others in you. 
Hear one strong word that might explain you. 
Pardon! With many questions I detain you. 
The rest a bold address will win you; 
Wilt thou grasp the thunder? Well that it has not been given to you, 
This, aged Sirs, belongs to you, 
Here is the genuine path for you; 
If not a husband, then a beau for you! 
Hang on your bosom and caress you; 
When foes in combat sorely press you; 
That now I vanish, pardon, I entreat you! 
When I upon the Blocksberg meet you, 
And what you'd like I'll undertake to get you. 
Who wouldn't lose his heart, that met you? 
How can a further test delight you? 
     Apples have been desired by you, 
And what will _you_? 
For Devils and for spectres this is law: 
Where they have entered in, there also they withdraw. 
All the repulsive cheats I view,-- 
But what comes sneaking, there, to view? 
He spake: "That is the proper view,-- 
How shall we plan, that all be fresh and new,-- 
     In thine own bosom build it anew! 
A game whose winnings no man ever knew,-- 
     There lies the brew! 
And such, forthwith, I'd have you brew. 
     Dame Baubo first, to lead the crew! 
     To the singing of thy crew. 
On your behalf, here, in my bosom grew; 
     Since first in Paradise they grew; 
     Ow! ow! ow! ow! 
Before which they bow, 
With such advantages endow! 
(_She opens the window_) 
MARTHA (_at the window_) 
MARGARET (_at the window_) 
        The pots before my window, 
When I am present she's impressed, she knows not how; 
Yes, your discourses, with their glittering show, 
To give his sweetheart a diverting show. 
Then a great public you can show. 
Had I a certificate to show! 
There's nothing special of my own to show! 
But on a gala-day one may his orders show. 
Are more than magic's empty show. 
Such an enamored fool in air would blow 
What once you did at a single blow, 
Are unrefreshing as the winds that blow 
        Into the tide below. 
The square below 
VOICE (_from below_) 
VOICE (_from below_) 
VOICE (_below_) 
HALF-WITCH (_below_) 
        And the magic flow 
Dare such a human voice disturb the flow, 
And the streets overflow: 
Thy nerves of touch ecstatic glow! 
The moon's lone disk, with its belated glow, 
The threefold dazzling glow! 
With light of power my soul shall glow, 
Obscuring Heaven's clear glow. 
Mark how, beneath the evening sunlight's glow, 
And meanwhile thou, alone, mayst glow 
So many a midnight,--would thy glow 
        And drank the last life-glow; 
Cease to bark and bellow! 
Woe's me, the fearful bellow! 
Such a noisy, disturbing fellow 
Bring cotton, quick! He's split my ears, that fellow. 
            As goes the crowd, I follow. 
     Hear I noises? songs that follow? 
     Of old days, come faint and hollow. 
     Stream and streamlet seek the hollow. 
We'll saunter to the Mill, in yonder hollow. 
As wife and child, as knave and plow! 
Yet, hast thou food which never satiates, now,-- 
                    Delay, now! 
Away, now! 
And both your ravens, where are _they_ now? 
And now-- 
Then you have reached the right place now. 
How? 
Where is our couple now? 
How? 
But what has happened, tell me now? 
     Alone, old Baubo's coming now; 
What hinders me from smiting now 
Look out, I'll smoke them now! 
And if the Earth don't open now 
The sign witness now, 
She feels that surely I'm a genius now,-- 
And even the fir-tree feels it now: 
Out of the cellar-door, just now. 
Once many a bit we sponged, but now, 
'Tis verily full many a day now. 
Ha! ha! That's just your way, I know: 
Full many a pleasant place I know, 
     And I am moved with joy, to know 
Wait not to know 
Wait not to know 
Ah, that simplicity and innocence ne'er know 
When I the starry courses know, 
Of saying the things I do not know,-- 
Days will be spent to bid you know, 
And there's a neat romance, completed ere you know! 
Upon my path I wish for frost and snow. 
Of name, and fame, and laurelled brow! 
A thousand germs break forth and grow, 
     That such within my garden grow. 
To grub with yearning force through Earth's dark marrow, 
Compress the six days' work within thy bosom narrow,-- 
The highest, lowest forms my soul shall borrow, 
Thou must begin to-morrow 
        What woe, what woe and sorrow 
Shall heap upon itself their bliss and sorrow, 
The work of sorrow! 
        I sat, in utter sorrow, 
        Where'er I go, what sorrow, 
Our shoes are all danced out, we trow, 
     The damnéd beast--the curséd sow! 
     She rides upon a farrow-sow. 
No longer guest-right I bestow; 
He shall not leave alive, I vow. 
Why, then will I myself, I vow, 
I notice no such thing, I vow! 
Not if he had them by the neck, I vow, 
I'd like to leave it, I must avow; 
     From five and six 
The gentle movement of Thy Day. 
I feel that men are ripe for Judgment-Day, 
     And driven at last, in open day, 
And is as whimsical as on Creation's day. 
Are bright as on the earliest day. 
She walks abroad unveiled by day, 
And she recovered, then, so slowly, day by day. 
All hearts that beat beneath the heavenly day-- 
Then at the Doctors'-banquet I, to-day, 
It's true, Sibylla said, to-day. 
That thus you condescend, to-day, 
We're for the Hunters' lodge, to-day. 
Carousing, to-day! 
We passed, without a call, to-day. 
Who was that gentleman, to-day. 
But then, reflect: the mountain's magic-mad to-day, 
He's surely not alone to-day: 
Is't not enough, that what I speak to-day 
Sons of Mieding, rest to-day! 
Might have the most genteel society to-day! 
  Shall be for me a harvest-day! 
And then a chance will come, a holiday, 
Here, for the folk, each day's a holiday: 
Proclaimed the Spring's rejoicing holiday; 
Oberon, the beauteous fay, 
Left me lie in the straw where I lay. 
So weak and miserable she lay; 
     Fell on the hearth, and squirming lay, 
The lark sends down his flickering lay,-- 
And here, on my right breast, my baby lay! 
Brass, marble, parchment, paper, clay? 
     In the damp moss and clay:_ 
     'Tis made of clay, 
'Tis no companion of Delay. 
Is such delight, my steps would fain delay. 
And supping there with Hans occasioned your delay? 
Out with your spit, without delay! 
Through this insane, chaotic play? 
With much delight I see the play, 
Is't but masquerading play? 
And it will seem a mocking play, 
But evil tongues in this town have full play. 
No, it is just in play. 
True, child is child, and play is play. 
As in a love-adventure they might play! 
Or, at the best, a Punch-and-Judy play, 
O yes, the gentleman finds it all child's-play! 
When, piece by piece, can one the things abroad display, 
But let her growth and strength display, 
The first was not a great display. 
Why should I fly? They'll still my steps waylay! 
But stipulating, that I may 
Most willingly, to what extent I may. 
And one becomes the talk, do whatsoe'er one may. 
     But howsoe'er she hasten may, 
Since from the devils I also may 
        Splendid the pay! 
        Splendid the pay! 
And more than ever we must pay! 
Promised them fullest heavenly pay, 
Misty vale and mountain gray, 
Continue, pray! 
How is't with thy religion, pray? 
But with the grapes how was it, pray? 
Ask you, pray? 
My friend, take proper heed, I pray! 
Give me a line or two, I pray. 
But not too very far, I pray! 
Sir Doctor, don't retreat, I pray! 
Wherefrom the fountain flings eternal spray, 
Like gossiping of war, and war's array, 
        In Beauty's array, 
The look, the manner, both betray-- 
The sweet young maiden to betray, 
A highly-learned man, to stray. 
She haunts her window, watching clouds that stray 
What! whirled so far astray? 
What wilt from me, Base Spirit, say?-- 
     Dear son, I say, 
How has he helped the town, I say? 
     And measure his coat, I say! 
And stroking then my beard, I'd say, 
Go to the River Tavern, I should say. 
He'll be with Curly-head, I heard him say. 
Draw power, whose measure none can say; 
"I believe in God!" to say? 
Then stand abashed, when thou art forced to say: 
Shall one believe no miracles, just say! 
I'd something give, could I but say 
Each in its language--say; 
An't please thee, also I'm content to stay, 
You meet by accident; you feel, you stay, 
Rejoiced am I that I may stay! 
The little god o' the world sticks to the same old way, 
     Man in one leap has cleared the way. 
And if a will-o'-the-wisp must guide you on the way, 
What need to shorten so the way? 
Then house-right I must use, and clear the way. 
To manage witches, this is just the way. 
Has still an instinct of the one true way. 
Before the Thunder's crashing way: 
Back from the last, the solemn way. 
"Each well enough in her own way. 
And yet, I think, dost not incline that way. 
Why do you go that way? 
But then, it's not a pleasant way. 
Now quick, away! 
Since to the lees _my_ cask is drained away, 
And she of him. So runs the world away! 
In all its tides sweeps not the world away, 
Of yearning onward, upward and away, 
Up and away! 
And will her foul mess take away 
And me a little away, 
It seems the mistress has gone away? 
        Marching away! 
VOICE (_from within, dying away_) 
And that a poodle ran away? 
I cannot really go away: 
When down in Turkey, far away, 
O'er the old city-wall, and far away. 
  He's only glad who gives away: 
To let thee see how smooth life runs away. 
At the first glance who sees it runs away. 
Said he: "When I from Malta went away 
                    Ay! we must away. 
     Keep thou away! 
     Fly away! Fly away_! 
Remains there naught of lofty spirit-sway, 
     The tailor came straightway: 
Off in the world he went straightway,-- 
As if the Holy Host came by. 
FAUST MARGARET _(passing by)_ 
     The wind is hushed, the star shoots by. 
The one who just went by. 
But let me suckle, first, my baby! 
We've too much tact and policy 
They never yet have been so pert and saucy. 
You face it out, impertinent and heady? 
Just wait! a shower of blows is ready. 
That it hath scented me already: 
Perceiv'st thou yonder snail? It cometh, slow and steady; 
A gray and wrinkled noddy; 
How sadly rises, incomplete and ruddy, 
And show a strapping body. 
'Tis winter still within my body: 
Let Poetry your will obey! 
And deeply edified were they. 
To follow servant-girls, when they 
Most wise! And first, of course, we'll make the journey 
For my Italian journey. 
Some outlines of the tourney; 
We made a Turkish merchantman our prey, 
We must make use of strategy. 
And even, alas! Theology,-- 
Who towards me pressed with all thine energy? 
Round all, in wrathful energy. 
I've studied now Philosophy 
There, now, is thine antipathy! 
The Holy Church has a stomach healthy: 
And viewed it with a favor stealthy. 
Have, from this desk, seen climb the sky 
     Break from the sky! 
Darting hither from the sky, 
Till darkness closes from the sky! 
     The dreary moon forsakes the sky; 
Once more, my friend, thou talkest sensibly. 
     Pierced irredressibly! 
     Named inexpressibly, 
It much becomes thee to be raving madly. 
Thy head is out of order, sadly: 
Assuredly. 
(_They drink repeatedly_.) 
(FAUST _looks around wildly_.) 
And, if you'll probe the thing profoundly, 
Knew you so much--and you'll confess it roundly!-- 
And old ones, veiled and hidden shrewdly: 
And I shall try to serve you nicely. 
On my account be kind, nor treat them rudely! 
A bit of purgatory 'twas for this time, merely. 
All that is promised shall delight thee purely; 
Made with you gentlemen--and binding,--surely? 
You mustn't take things too precisely. 
Good Sir, you see the facts precisely 
We must arrange them now, more wisely, 
THE WITCH (_laughs immoderately_) 
A girl that takes my heart, completely. 
This first line let me weigh completely, 
I've everywhere, in fact, been entertained politely. 
Behold my wares attentively: 
To his neck will I fly, 
But come, away! 'Tis time for us to fly; 
     The cook laid poison cunningly, 
He looks around so sneeringly, 
Which Nature portions out so lovingly-- 
Yes, he deserves your favor thoroughly,-- 
And of a noble family; 
The art is old and new, for verily 
I see one yonder, burning merrily. 
Tis magic all, thou fool, seduced so easily! 
He rises mightily: 
                         And heartily! 
His pink of girls right lustily, 
(_He takes_ SIEBEL _by the nose: the others do the same reciprocally, 
And had I not the Flame reserved, why, really, 
Note her especially, 
Find'st nothing right on earth, eternally? 
In dry, and wet, and warm, and chilly; 
     So cannibalic jolly! 
Must play the Devil again, and fully. 
Will have it, certainly. 
And is it thou? Thou, surely, certainly? 
I locked the press, most certainly. 
        To see him, him only, 
        To meet him, him only, 
Upon my brow, in Sabbath silence holy; 
That her salvation is,--with scruples holy 
A good reply! 
The Mighty Spirit deigns me no reply, 
What mean you? Wait!--you'll pay for't dearly! 
        Grave, and all-gloriously 
        Has He, victoriously, 
Then, too, when night descends, how anxiously 
Grasp me not so murderously! 
Those, dressed so prettily and neatly. 
Lest my impatient pen proceed too fleetly. 
I think we'd better send him packing quietly. 
With one begin'st thou secretly, 
I mean, have you not felt desire, though ne'er so slightly? 
It may be that your eyes deceive you slightly; 
A streaming trail of fire, if I see rightly, 
    And so, at last, it serves her rightly. 
She clung to the fellow so long and tightly! 
Why heat thyself, thus instantly, 
his hand. _FAUST_ turns impatiently_.) 
Seize me not thus so violently! 
Himself a whole so frequently, 
I praise the old ones, not unduly: 
'Twere easier groping forward, truly. 
Why, Zounds! Both hands and feet are, truly-- 
When we were all-in-all, then, truly, 
     Do thy bidding, guide us truly, 
     We, it seems, have entered newly 
Yet all that I indulge in newly, 
How this pure soul, of faith so lowly, 
And, filled with mystic presage, chimed the church-bell slowly, 
And then, how masterly she reads physiognomy! 
Only by mass you touch the mass; for any 
Who offers much, brings something unto many, 
That thou art in such company. 
With proved adepts in company, 
Is't not sufficient company? 
     Living knots and gnarls uncanny 
Within my press! Of ebony,-- 
Beside the good Saint Antony, 
Than in the year's monotony. 
Twas Perseus lopped it, her old adversary. 
Or from behind struck down the adversary. 
No sword, but severed ties for the unwary, 
For there arises now a murderous cry. 
That is all the scenery. 
Needless your machinery: 
Shall I outlive this misery? 
Almighty God! what misery! 
And this one Book of Mystery 
Is always for the wise, no less than fools, a mystery. 
Follows his path of mystery. 
Suggest their own delivery; 
Among this witches' revelry 
Ah, not alone the jewelry! 
What! Not a pocket-piece? no jewelry? 
Henry! Henry! 
Promise me, Henry!-- 
This drear, accursed masonry, 
Thus shall you hit the mark of gain and glory. 
Seek to confound your auditory! 
Such time I've squandered o'er the history: 
So delicately its feelers pry, 
It's as if nobody had nothing to fetch and carry, 
     Fragments into the Void we carry, 
Her head beneath her arm she'll sometimes carry; 
Alas, that trade and duty us so harry! 
You've but to lunge, and I will parry. 
I'd ask you, longer here to tarry, 
And dares not even now and then to tarry! 
Stand by: I'll lead, if you'll but tarry: 
Reason becomes a sham, Beneficence a worry: 
Yet I would take again, and willing, all the worry, 
But now my days have less of noise and hurry; 
This to consider, there's, alas! no hurry. 
I cannot here disguise me, if I try. 
They gladly hearken, prompt for injury,-- 
To grasp the spirit of Medicine is easy: 
Why, 'twas a real ecstasy! 
I now am conscious. With this ecstasy, 
Such works are held as antiquate and mossy; 
        Castles, with lofty 
No beastliness and no stupidity. 
Take notice, first! their bestiality 
And I, as suits their quality, 
Blood is a juice of rarest quality. 
Since all that's coarse provokes my enmity. 
For thou hast no Christianity. 
The highest right, supreme Humanity, 
And also made their opportunity. 
  A holiday, that shows your pity, 
If _I_ should choose to preach Posterity, 
The right born with us, ours in verity, 
Yet choose thyself a faculty! 
As though my legs were four-and-twenty. 
The temple-halls of Certainty. 
How from the window of the sacristy 
  Let me not vainly sing my ditty; 
Enjoy the rich, the ever-living Beauty! 
Metaphysics learn the use and beauty! 
But ye, God's sons in love and duty, 
A word steps promptly in as deputy. 
******************************************************
Again ye come, ye hovering Forms! I find ye,
As early to my clouded sight ye shone!
Shall I attempt, this once, to seize and bind ye?
Still o'er my heart is that illusion thrown?
Ye crowd more near! Then, be the reign assigned ye,
And sway me from your misty, shadowy zone!
My bosom thrills, with youthful passion shaken,
From magic airs that round your march awaken.

Of joyous days ye bring the blissful vision;
The dear, familiar phantoms rise again,
And, like an old and half-extinct tradition,
First Love returns, with Friendship in his train.
Renewed is Pain: with mournful repetition
Life tracks his devious, labyrinthine chain,
And names the Good, whose cheating fortune tore them
From happy hours, and left me to deplore them.

They hear no longer these succeeding measures,
The souls, to whom my earliest songs I sang:

Dispersed the friendly troop, with all its pleasures,
And still, alas! the echoes first that rang!
I bring the unknown multitude my treasures;
Their very plaudits give my heart a pang,
And those beside, whose joy my Song so flattered,
If still they live, wide through the world are scattered.

And grasps me now a long-unwonted yearning
For that serene and solemn Spirit-Land:
My song, to faint Aeolian murmurs turning,
Sways like a harp-string by the breezes fanned.
I thrill and tremble; tear on tear is burning,
And the stern heart is tenderly unmanned.
What I possess, I see far distant lying,
And what I lost, grows real and undying.

MANAGER    DRAMATIC POET    MERRY-ANDREW

MANAGER

You two, who oft a helping hand
Have lent, in need and tribulation.
Come, let me know your expectation
Of this, our enterprise, in German land!
I wish the crowd to feel itself well treated,
Especially since it lives and lets me live;
The posts are set, the booth of boards completed.
And each awaits the banquet I shall give.
Already there, with curious eyebrows raised,
They sit sedate, and hope to be amazed.
I know how one the People's taste may flatter,
Yet here a huge embarrassment I feel:
What they're accustomed to, is no great matter,
But then, alas! they've read an awful deal.
How shall we plan, that all be fresh and new,--
Important matter, yet attractive too?
For 'tis my pleasure-to behold them surging,
When to our booth the current sets apace,
And with tremendous, oft-repeated urging,
Squeeze onward through the narrow gate of grace:
By daylight even, they push and cram in
To reach the seller's box, a fighting host,
And as for bread, around a baker's door, in famine,
To get a ticket break their necks almost.
This miracle alone can work the Poet
On men so various: now, my friend, pray show it.


POET


Speak not to me of yonder motley masses,
Whom but to see, puts out the fire of Song!
Hide from my view the surging crowd that passes,
And in its whirlpool forces us along!
No, lead me where some heavenly silence glasses
The purer joys that round the Poet throng,--
Where Love and Friendship still divinely fashion
The bonds that bless, the wreaths that crown his passion!
Ah, every utterance from the depths of feeling
The timid lips have stammeringly expressed,--
Now failing, now, perchance, success revealing,--
Gulps the wild Moment in its greedy breast;
Or oft, reluctant years its warrant sealing,
Its perfect stature stands at last confessed!
What dazzles, for the Moment spends its spirit:
What's genuine, shall Posterity inherit.


MERRY-ANDREW


Posterity! Don't name the word to me!
If _I_ should choose to preach Posterity,
Where would you get contemporary fun?
That men _will_ have it, there's no blinking:
A fine young fellow's presence, to my thinking,
Is something worth, to every one.
Who genially his nature can outpour,
Takes from the People's moods no irritation;
The wider circle he acquires, the more
Securely works his inspiration.
Then pluck up heart, and give us sterling coin!
Let Fancy be with her attendants fitted,--
Sense, Reason, Sentiment, and Passion join,--
But have a care, lest Folly be omitted!

MANAGER

Chiefly, enough of incident prepare!
They come to look, and they prefer to stare.
Reel off a host of threads before their faces,
So that they gape in stupid wonder: then
By sheer diffuseness you have won their graces,
And are, at once, most popular of men.
Only by mass you touch the mass; for any
Will finally, himself, his bit select:
Who offers much, brings something unto many,
And each goes home content with the effect,
If you've a piece, why, just in pieces give it:
A hash, a stew, will bring success, believe it!
'Tis easily displayed, and easy to invent.
What use, a Whole compactly to present?
Your hearers pick and pluck, as soon as they receive it!

POET

You do not feel, how such a trade debases;
How ill it suits the Artist, proud and true!
The botching work each fine pretender traces
Is, I perceive, a principle with you.

MANAGER

Such a reproach not in the least offends;
A man who some result intends
Must use the tools that best are fitting.
Reflect, soft wood is given to you for splitting,
And then, observe for whom you write!
If one comes bored, exhausted quite,
Another, satiate, leaves the banquet's tapers,
And, worst of all, full many a wight
Is fresh from reading of the daily papers.
Idly to us they come, as to a masquerade,
Mere curiosity their spirits warming:
The ladies with themselves, and with their finery, aid,
Without a salary their parts performing.
What dreams are yours in high poetic places?
You're pleased, forsooth, full houses to behold?
Draw near, and view your patrons' faces!
The half are coarse, the half are cold.
One, when the play is out, goes home to cards;
A wild night on a wench's breast another chooses:
Why should you rack, poor, foolish bards,
For ends like these, the gracious Muses?
I tell you, give but more--more, ever more, they ask:
Thus shall you hit the mark of gain and glory.
Seek to confound your auditory!
To satisfy them is a task.--
What ails you now? Is't suffering, or pleasure?

POET

Go, find yourself a more obedient slave!
What! shall the Poet that which Nature gave,
The highest right, supreme Humanity,
Forfeit so wantonly, to swell your treasure?
Whence o'er the heart his empire free?
The elements of Life how conquers he?
Is't not his heart's accord, urged outward far and dim,
To wind the world in unison with him?
When on the spindle, spun to endless distance,
By Nature's listless hand the thread is twirled,
And the discordant tones of all existence
In sullen jangle are together hurled,
Who, then, the changeless orders of creation
Divides, and kindles into rhythmic dance?
Who brings the One to join the general ordination,
Where it may throb in grandest consonance?
Who bids the storm to passion stir the bosom?
In brooding souls the sunset burn above?
Who scatters every fairest April blossom
Along the shining path of Love?
Who braids the noteless leaves to crowns, requiting
Desert with fame, in Action's every field?
Who makes Olympus sure, the Gods uniting?
The might of Man, as in the Bard revealed.

MERRY-ANDREW

So, these fine forces, in conjunction,
Propel the high poetic function,
As in a love-adventure they might play!
You meet by accident; you feel, you stay,
And by degrees your heart is tangled;
Bliss grows apace, and then its course is jangled;
You're ravished quite, then comes a touch of woe,
And there's a neat romance, completed ere you know!
Let us, then, such a drama give!
Grasp the exhaustless life that all men live!
Each shares therein, though few may comprehend:
Where'er you touch, there's interest without end.
In motley pictures little light,
Much error, and of truth a glimmering mite,
Thus the best beverage is supplied,
Whence all the world is cheered and edified.
Then, at your play, behold the fairest flower
Of youth collect, to hear the revelation!
Each tender soul, with sentimental power,
Sucks melancholy food from your creation;
And now in this, now that, the leaven works.
For each beholds what in his bosom lurks.
They still are moved at once to weeping or to laughter,
Still wonder at your flights, enjoy the show they see:
A mind, once formed, is never suited after;
One yet in growth will ever grateful be.

POET

Then give me back that time of pleasures,
While yet in joyous growth I sang,--
When, like a fount, the crowding measures
Uninterrupted gushed and sprang!
Then bright mist veiled the world before me,
In opening buds a marvel woke,
As I the thousand blossoms broke,
Which every valley richly bore me!
I nothing had, and yet enough for youth--
Joy in Illusion, ardent thirst for Truth.
Give, unrestrained, the old emotion,
The bliss that touched the verge of pain,
The strength of Hate, Love's deep devotion,--
O, give me back my youth again!

MERRY ANDREW

Youth, good my friend, you certainly require
When foes in combat sorely press you;
When lovely maids, in fond desire,
Hang on your bosom and caress you;
When from the hard-won goal the wreath
Beckons afar, the race awaiting;
When, after dancing out your breath,
You pass the night in dissipating:--
But that familiar harp with soul
To play,--with grace and bold expression,
And towards a self-erected goal
To walk with many a sweet digression,--
This, aged Sirs, belongs to you,
And we no less revere you for that reason:
Age childish makes, they say, but 'tis not true;
We're only genuine children still, in Age's season!


MANAGER

The words you've bandied are sufficient;
'Tis deeds that I prefer to see:
In compliments you're both proficient,
But might, the while, more useful be.
What need to talk of Inspiration?
'Tis no companion of Delay.
If Poetry be your vocation,
Let Poetry your will obey!
Full well you know what here is wanting;
The crowd for strongest drink is panting,
And such, forthwith, I'd have you brew.
What's left undone to-day, To-morrow will not do.
Waste not a day in vain digression:
With resolute, courageous trust
Seize every possible impression,
And make it firmly your possession;
You'll then work on, because you must.
Upon our German stage, you know it,
Each tries his hand at what he will;
So, take of traps and scenes your fill,
And all you find, be sure to show it!
Use both the great and lesser heavenly light,--
Squander the stars in any number,
Beasts, birds, trees, rocks, and all such lumber,
Fire, water, darkness, Day and Night!
Thus, in our booth's contracted sphere,
The circle of Creation will appear,
And move, as we deliberately impel,
From Heaven, across the World, to Hell!

PROLOGUE IN HEAVEN

THE LORD THE HEAVENLY HOST _Afterwards_
MEPHISTOPHELES

(_The_ THREE ARCHANGELS _come forward_.)


RAPHAEL

The sun-orb sings, in emulation,
'Mid brother-spheres, his ancient round:
His path predestined through Creation
He ends with step of thunder-sound.
The angels from his visage splendid
Draw power, whose measure none can say;
The lofty works, uncomprehended,
Are bright as on the earliest day.


GABRIEL

And swift, and swift beyond conceiving,
The splendor of the world goes round,
Day's Eden-brightness still relieving
The awful Night's intense profound:
The ocean-tides in foam are breaking,
Against the rocks' deep bases hurled,
And both, the spheric race partaking,
Eternal, swift, are onward whirled!


MICHAEL

And rival storms abroad are surging
From sea to land, from land to sea.
A chain of deepest action forging
Round all, in wrathful energy.
There flames a desolation, blazing
Before the Thunder's crashing way:
Yet, Lord, Thy messengers are praising
The gentle movement of Thy Day.


THE THREE

Though still by them uncomprehended,
From these the angels draw their power,
And all Thy works, sublime and splendid,
Are bright as in Creation's hour.


MEPHISTOPHELES

Since Thou, O Lord, deign'st to approach again
And ask us how we do, in manner kindest,
And heretofore to meet myself wert fain,
Among Thy menials, now, my face Thou findest.
Pardon, this troop I cannot follow after
With lofty speech, though by them scorned and spurned:
My pathos certainly would move Thy laughter,
If Thou hadst not all merriment unlearned.
Of suns and worlds I've nothing to be quoted;
How men torment themselves, is all I've noted.
The little god o' the world sticks to the same old way,
And is as whimsical as on Creation's day.
Life somewhat better might content him,
But for the gleam of heavenly light which Thou hast lent
  him:
He calls it Reason--thence his power's increased,
To be far beastlier than any beast.
Saving Thy Gracious Presence, he to me
A long-legged grasshopper appears to be,
That springing flies, and flying springs,
And in the grass the same old ditty sings.
Would he still lay among the grass he grows in!
Each bit of dung he seeks, to stick his nose in.


THE LORD

Hast thou, then, nothing more to mention?
Com'st ever, thus, with ill intention?
Find'st nothing right on earth, eternally?


MEPHISTOPHELES

No, Lord! I find things, there, still bad as they can be.
Man's misery even to pity moves my nature;
I've scarce the heart to plague the wretched creature.


THE LORD

Know'st Faust?


MEPHISTOPHELES

The Doctor Faust?


THE LORD

My servant, he!


MEPHISTOPHELES

Forsooth! He serves you after strange devices:
No earthly meat or drink the fool suffices:
His spirit's ferment far aspireth;
Half conscious of his frenzied, crazed unrest,
The fairest stars from Heaven he requireth,
From Earth the highest raptures and the best,
And all the Near and Far that he desireth
Fails to subdue the tumult of his breast.


THE LORD

Though still confused his service unto Me,
I soon shall lead him to a clearer morning.
Sees not the gardener, even while buds his tree,
Both flower and fruit the future years adorning?


MEPHISTOPHELES

What will you bet? There's still a chance to gain him,
If unto me full leave you give,
Gently upon _my_ road to train him!


THE LORD

As long as he on earth shall live,
So long I make no prohibition.
While Man's desires and aspirations stir,
He cannot choose but err.


MEPHISTOPHELES

My thanks! I find the dead no acquisition,
And never cared to have them in my keeping.
I much prefer the cheeks where ruddy blood is leaping,
And when a corpse approaches, close my house:
It goes with me, as with the cat the mouse.


THE LORD

Enough! What thou hast asked is granted.
Turn off this spirit from his fountain-head;
To trap him, let thy snares be planted,
And him, with thee, be downward led;
Then stand abashed, when thou art forced to say:
A good man, through obscurest aspiration,
Has still an instinct of the one true way.


MEPHISTOPHELES

Agreed! But 'tis a short probation.
About my bet I feel no trepidation.
If I fulfill my expectation,
You'll let me triumph with a swelling breast:
Dust shall he eat, and with a zest,
As did a certain snake, my near relation.


THE LORD

Therein thou'rt free, according to thy merits;
The like of thee have never moved My hate.
Of all the bold, denying Spirits,
The waggish knave least trouble doth create.
Man's active nature, flagging, seeks too soon the level;
Unqualified repose he learns to crave;
Whence, willingly, the comrade him I gave,
Who works, excites, and must create, as Devil.
But ye, God's sons in love and duty,
Enjoy the rich, the ever-living Beauty!
Creative Power, that works eternal schemes,
Clasp you in bonds of love, relaxing never,
And what in wavering apparition gleams
Fix in its place with thoughts that stand forever!


(_Heaven closes: the_ ARCHANGELS _separate_.)


MEPHISTOPHELES (_solus_)

I like, at times, to hear The Ancient's word,
And have a care to be most civil:
It's really kind of such a noble Lord
So humanly to gossip with the Devil!

FIRST PART OF THE TRAGEDY

I

NIGHT

(_A lofty-arched, narrow, Gothic chamber_. FAUST, _in a chair at his
desk, restless_.)


FAUST

I've studied now Philosophy
And Jurisprudence, Medicine,--
And even, alas! Theology,--
From end to end, with labor keen;
And here, poor fool! with all my lore
I stand, no wiser than before:
I'm Magister--yea, Doctor--hight,
And straight or cross-wise, wrong or right,
These ten years long, with many woes,
I've led my scholars by the nose,--
And see, that nothing can be known!
_That_ knowledge cuts me to the bone.
I'm cleverer, true, than those fops of teachers,
Doctors and Magisters, Scribes and Preachers;
Neither scruples nor doubts come now to smite me,
Nor Hell nor Devil can longer affright me.

For this, all pleasure am I foregoing;
I do not pretend to aught worth knowing,
I do not pretend I could be a teacher
To help or convert a fellow-creature.
Then, too, I've neither lands nor gold,
Nor the world's least pomp or honor hold--
No dog would endure such a curst existence!
Wherefore, from Magic I seek assistance,
That many a secret perchance I reach
Through spirit-power and spirit-speech,
And thus the bitter task forego
Of saying the things I do not know,--
That I may detect the inmost force
Which binds the world, and guides its course;
Its germs, productive powers explore,
And rummage in empty words no more!

O full and splendid Moon, whom I
Have, from this desk, seen climb the sky
So many a midnight,--would thy glow
For the last time beheld my woe!
Ever thine eye, most mournful friend,
O'er books and papers saw me bend;
But would that I, on mountains grand,
Amid thy blessed light could stand,
With spirits through mountain-caverns hover,
Float in thy twilight the meadows over,
And, freed from the fumes of lore that swathe me,
To health in thy dewy fountains bathe me!

Ah, me! this dungeon still I see.
This drear, accursed masonry,
Where even the welcome daylight strains
But duskly through the painted panes.
Hemmed in by many a toppling heap
Of books worm-eaten, gray with dust,
Which to the vaulted ceiling creep,
Against the smoky paper thrust,--
With glasses, boxes, round me stacked,
And instruments together hurled,
Ancestral lumber, stuffed and packed--
Such is my world: and what a world!

And do I ask, wherefore my heart
Falters, oppressed with unknown needs?
Why some inexplicable smart
All movement of my life impedes?
Alas! in living Nature's stead,
Where God His human creature set,
In smoke and mould the fleshless dead
And bones of beasts surround me yet!

Fly! Up, and seek the broad, free land!
And this one Book of Mystery
From Nostradamus' very hand,
Is't not sufficient company?
When I the starry courses know,
And Nature's wise instruction seek,
With light of power my soul shall glow,
As when to spirits spirits speak.
Tis vain, this empty brooding here,
Though guessed the holy symbols be:
Ye, Spirits, come--ye hover near--
Oh, if you hear me, answer me!

(_He opens the Book, and perceives the sign of the Macrocosm_.)

Ha! what a sudden rapture leaps from this
I view, through all my senses swiftly flowing!
I feel a youthful, holy, vital bliss
In every vein and fibre newly glowing.
Was it a God, who traced this sign,
With calm across my tumult stealing,
My troubled heart to joy unsealing,
With impulse, mystic and divine,
The powers of Nature here, around my path, revealing?
Am I a God?--so clear mine eyes!
In these pure features I behold
Creative Nature to my soul unfold.
What says the sage, now first I recognize:
"The spirit-world no closures fasten;
Thy sense is shut, thy heart is dead:
Disciple, up! untiring, hasten
To bathe thy breast in morning-red!"

(_He contemplates the sign_.)

How each the Whole its substance gives,
Each in the other works and lives!
Like heavenly forces rising and descending,
Their golden urns reciprocally lending,
With wings that winnow blessing
From Heaven through Earth I see them pressing,
Filling the All with harmony unceasing!
How grand a show! but, ah! a show alone.
Thee, boundless Nature, how make thee my own?
Where you, ye beasts? Founts of all Being, shining,
Whereon hang Heaven's and Earth's desire,
Whereto our withered hearts aspire,--
Ye flow, ye feed: and am I vainly pining?

(_He turns the leaves impatiently, and perceives the sign of the
Earth-Spirit_.)

How otherwise upon me works this sign!
Thou, Spirit of the Earth, art nearer:
Even now my powers are loftier, clearer;
I glow, as drunk with new-made wine:
New strength and heart to meet the world incite me,
The woe of earth, the bliss of earth, invite me,
And though the shock of storms may smite me,
No crash of shipwreck shall have power to fright me!
Clouds gather over me--
The moon conceals her light--
The lamp's extinguished!--
Mists rise,--red, angry rays are darting
Around my head!--There falls
A horror from the vaulted roof,
And seizes me!
I feel thy presence, Spirit I invoke!
Reveal thyself!
Ha! in my heart what rending stroke!
With new impulsion
My senses heave in this convulsion!
I feel thee draw my heart, absorb, exhaust me:
Thou must! thou must! and though my life it cost me!

(_He seizes the book, and mysteriously pronounces the sign of
the Spirit. A ruddy flame flashes: the Spirit appears in
the flame_.)


SPIRIT

Who calls me?


FAUST (_with averted head_)

Terrible to see!


SPIRIT

Me hast thou long with might attracted,
Long from my sphere thy food exacted,
And now--

FAUST

  Woe! I endure not thee!


SPIRIT

To view me is thine aspiration,
My voice to hear, my countenance to see;
Thy powerful yearning moveth me,
Here am I!--what mean perturbation
Thee, superhuman, shakes? Thy soul's high calling, where?
Where is the breast, which from itself a world did bear,
And shaped and cherished--which with joy expanded,
To be our peer, with us, the Spirits, banded?
Where art thou, Faust, whose voice has pierced to me,
Who towards me pressed with all thine energy?
_He_ art thou, who, my presence breathing, seeing,
Trembles through all the depths of being,
A writhing worm, a terror-stricken form?


FAUST

Thee, form of flame, shall I then fear?
Yes, I am Faust: I am thy peer!


SPIRIT

  In the tides of Life, in Action's storm,
  A fluctuant wave,
  A shuttle free,
  Birth and the Grave,
  An eternal sea,
  A weaving, flowing
  Life, all-glowing,
Thus at Time's humming loom 'tis my hand prepares
The garment of Life which the Deity wears!


FAUST

Thou, who around the wide world wendest,
Thou busy Spirit, how near I feel to thee!


SPIRIT

Thou'rt like the Spirit which thou comprehendest,
Not me!

(_Disappears_.)


FAUST (_overwhelmed_)

Not thee!
Whom then?
I, image of the Godhead!
Not even like thee!

(_A knock_).

O Death!--I know it--'tis my Famulus!
My fairest luck finds no fruition:
In all the fullness of my vision
The soulless sneak disturbs me thus!

(_Enter_ WAGNER_, in dressing-gown and night-cap, a lamp in
his hand. _FAUST_ turns impatiently_.)


WAGNER

Pardon, I heard your declamation;
'Twas sure an old Greek tragedy you read?
In such an art I crave some preparation,
Since now it stands one in good stead.
I've often heard it said, a preacher
Might learn, with a comedian for a teacher.


FAUST

Yes, when the priest comedian is by nature,
As haply now and then the case may be.


WAGNER

Ah, when one studies thus, a prisoned creature,
That scarce the world on holidays can see,--
Scarce through a glass, by rare occasion,
How shall one lead it by persuasion?


FAUST

You'll ne'er attain it, save you know the feeling,
Save from the soul it rises clear,
Serene in primal strength, compelling
The hearts and minds of all who hear.
You sit forever gluing, patching;
You cook the scraps from others' fare;
And from your heap of ashes hatching
A starveling flame, ye blow it bare!
Take children's, monkeys' gaze admiring,
If such your taste, and be content;
But ne'er from heart to heart you'll speak inspiring,
Save your own heart is eloquent!


WAGNER

Yet through delivery orators succeed;
I feel that I am far behind, indeed.


FAUST

Seek thou the honest recompense!
Beware, a tinkling fool to be!
With little art, clear wit and sense
Suggest their own delivery;
And if thou'rt moved to speak in earnest,
What need, that after words thou yearnest?
Yes, your discourses, with their glittering show,
Where ye for men twist shredded thought like paper,
Are unrefreshing as the winds that blow
The rustling leaves through chill autumnal vapor!


WAGNER

Ah, God! but Art is long,
And Life, alas! is fleeting.
And oft, with zeal my critic-duties meeting,
In head and breast there's something wrong.

How hard it is to compass the assistance
Whereby one rises to the source!
And, haply, ere one travels half the course
Must the poor devil quit existence.


FAUST

Is parchment, then, the holy fount before thee,
A draught wherefrom thy thirst forever slakes?
No true refreshment can restore thee,
Save what from thine own soul spontaneous breaks.


WAGNER

Pardon! a great delight is granted
When, in the spirit of the ages planted,
We mark how, ere our times, a sage has thought,
And then, how far his work, and grandly, we have brought.


FAUST

O yes, up to the stars at last!
Listen, my friend: the ages that are past
Are now a book with seven seals protected:
What you the Spirit of the Ages call
Is nothing but the spirit of you all,
Wherein the Ages are reflected.
So, oftentimes, you miserably mar it!
At the first glance who sees it runs away.
An offal-barrel and a lumber-garret,
Or, at the best, a Punch-and-Judy play,
With maxims most pragmatical and hitting,
As in the mouths of puppets are befitting!


WAGNER

But then, the world--the human heart and brain!
Of these one covets some slight apprehension.


FAUST

Yes, of the kind which men attain!
Who dares the child's true name in public mention?
The few, who thereof something really learned,
Unwisely frank, with hearts that spurned concealing,
And to the mob laid bare each thought and feeling,
Have evermore been crucified and burned.
I pray you, Friend, 'tis now the dead of night;
Our converse here must be suspended.


WAGNER

I would have shared your watches with delight,
That so our learned talk might be extended.
To-morrow, though, I'll ask, in Easter leisure,
This and the other question, at your pleasure.
Most zealously I seek for erudition:
Much do I know--but to know all is my ambition.

                                            [_Exit_.


FAUST (_solus_)

That brain, alone, not loses hope, whose choice is
To stick in shallow trash forevermore,--
Which digs with eager hand for buried ore,
And, when it finds an angle-worm, rejoices!

Dare such a human voice disturb the flow,
Around me here, of spirit-presence fullest?
And yet, this once my thanks I owe
To thee, of all earth's sons the poorest, dullest!
For thou hast torn me from that desperate state
Which threatened soon to overwhelm my senses:
The apparition was so giant-great,
It dwarfed and withered all my soul's pretences!

I, image of the Godhead, who began--
Deeming Eternal Truth secure in nearness--
Ye choirs, have ye begun the sweet, consoling chant,
Which, through the night of Death, the angels ministrant
Sang, God's new Covenant repeating?


CHORUS OF WOMEN

          With spices and precious
          Balm, we arrayed him;
          Faithful and gracious,
          We tenderly laid him:
          Linen to bind him
          Cleanlily wound we:
          Ah! when we would find him,
          Christ no more found we!


CHORUS OF ANGELS

          Christ is ascended!
          Bliss hath invested him,--
          Woes that molested him,
          Trials that tested him,
          Gloriously ended!


FAUST

Why, here in dust, entice me with your spell,
Ye gentle, powerful sounds of Heaven?
Peal rather there, where tender natures dwell.
Your messages I hear, but faith has not been given;
The dearest child of Faith is Miracle.
I venture not to soar to yonder regions
Whence the glad tidings hither float;
And yet, from childhood up familiar with the note,
To Life it now renews the old allegiance.
Once Heavenly Love sent down a burning kiss
Upon my brow, in Sabbath silence holy;
And, filled with mystic presage, chimed the church-bell slowly,
And prayer dissolved me in a fervent bliss.
A sweet, uncomprehended yearning
Drove forth my feet through woods and meadows free,
And while a thousand tears were burning,
I felt a world arise for me.
These chants, to youth and all its sports appealing,
Proclaimed the Spring's rejoicing holiday;
And Memory holds me now, with childish feeling,
Back from the last, the solemn way.
Sound on, ye hymns of Heaven, so sweet and mild!
My tears gush forth: the Earth takes back her child!


CHORUS OF DISCIPLES

        Has He, victoriously,
        Burst from the vaulted
        Grave, and all-gloriously
        Now sits exalted?
        Is He, in glow of birth,
        Rapture creative near?
        Ah! to the woe of earth
        Still are we native here.
        We, his aspiring
        Followers, Him we miss;
        Weeping, desiring,
        Master, Thy bliss!

CHORUS OF ANGELS

        Christ is arisen,
        Out of Corruption's womb:
        Burst ye the prison,
        Break from your gloom!
        Praising and pleading him,
        Lovingly needing him,
        Brotherly feeding him,
        Preaching and speeding him,
        Blessing, succeeding Him,
        Thus is the Master near,--
        Thus is He here!

II

BEFORE THE CITY-GATE

(_Pedestrians of all kinds come forth_.)


SEVERAL APPRENTICES

Why do you go that way?


OTHERS

We're for the Hunters' lodge, to-day.


THE FIRST

We'll saunter to the Mill, in yonder hollow.


AN APPRENTICE

Go to the River Tavern, I should say.


SECOND APPRENTICE

But then, it's not a pleasant way.


THE OTHERS

And what will _you_?

A THIRD

            As goes the crowd, I follow.


A FOURTH

Come up to Burgdorf? There you'll find good cheer,
The finest lasses and the best of beer,
And jolly rows and squabbles, trust me!


A FIFTH

You swaggering fellow, is your hide
A third time itching to be tried?
I won't go there, your jolly rows disgust me!


SERVANT-GIRL

No,--no! I'll turn and go to town again.


ANOTHER

We'll surely find him by those poplars yonder.


THE FIRST

That's no great luck for me, 'tis plain.
You'll have him, when and where you wander:
His partner in the dance you'll be,--
But what is all your fun to me?


THE OTHER

He's surely not alone to-day:
He'll be with Curly-head, I heard him say.


A STUDENT

Deuce! how they step, the buxom wenches!
Come, Brother! we must see them to the benches.
A strong, old beer, a pipe that stings and bites,
A girl in Sunday clothes,--these three are my delights.


CITIZEN'S DAUGHTER

Just see those handsome fellows, there!
It's really shameful, I declare;--
To follow servant-girls, when they
Might have the most genteel society to-day!


SECOND STUDENT (_to the First_)

Not quite so fast! Two others come behind,--
Those, dressed so prettily and neatly.
My neighbor's one of them, I find,
A girl that takes my heart, completely.
They go their way with looks demure,
But they'll accept us, after all, I'm sure.


THE FIRST

No, Brother! not for me their formal ways.
Quick! lest our game escape us in the press:
The hand that wields the broom on Saturdays
Will best, on Sundays, fondle and caress.


CITIZEN

He suits me not at all, our new-made Burgomaster!
Since he's installed, his arrogance grows faster.
How has he helped the town, I say?
Things worsen,--what improvement names he?
Obedience, more than ever, claims he,
And more than ever we must pay!


BEGGAR (_sings_)

  Good gentlemen and lovely ladies,
  So red of cheek and fine of dress,
  Behold, how needful here your aid is,
  And see and lighten my distress!
  Let me not vainly sing my ditty;
  He's only glad who gives away:
  A holiday, that shows your pity,
  Shall be for me a harvest-day!


ANOTHER CITIZEN

On Sundays, holidays, there's naught I take delight in,
Like gossiping of war, and war's array,
When down in Turkey, far away,
The foreign people are a-fighting.
One at the window sits, with glass and friends,
And sees all sorts of ships go down the river gliding:
And blesses then, as home he wends
At night, our times of peace abiding.


THIRD CITIZEN

Yes, Neighbor! that's my notion, too:
Why, let them break their heads, let loose their passions,
And mix things madly through and through,
So, here, we keep our good old fashions!


OLD WOMAN (_to the Citizen's Daughter_)

Dear me, how fine! So handsome, and so young!
Who wouldn't lose his heart, that met you?
Don't be so proud! I'll hold my tongue,
And what you'd like I'll undertake to get you.


CITIZEN'S DAUGHTER

Come, Agatha! I shun the witch's sight
Before folks, lest there be misgiving:
'Tis true, she showed me, on Saint Andrew's Night,
My future sweetheart, just as he were living.


THE OTHER

She showed me mine, in crystal clear,
With several wild young blades, a soldier-lover:
I seek him everywhere, I pry and peer,
And yet, somehow, his face I can't discover.

SOLDIERS

        Castles, with lofty
        Ramparts and towers,
        Maidens disdainful
        In Beauty's array,
        Both shall be ours!
        Bold is the venture,
        Splendid the pay!
        Lads, let the trumpets
        For us be suing,--
        Calling to pleasure,
        Calling to ruin.
        Stormy our life is;
        Such is its boon!
        Maidens and castles
        Capitulate soon.
        Bold is the venture,
        Splendid the pay!
        And the soldiers go marching,
        Marching away!


FAUST AND WAGNER


FAUST

Released from ice are brook and river
By the quickening glance of the gracious Spring;
The colors of hope to the valley cling,
And weak old Winter himself must shiver,
Withdrawn to the mountains, a crownless king:
Whence, ever retreating, he sends again
Impotent showers of sleet that darkle
In belts across the green o' the plain.
But the sun will permit no white to sparkle;
Everywhere form in development moveth;
He will brighten the world with the tints he loveth,
And, lacking blossoms, blue, yellow, and red,
He takes these gaudy people instead.
Turn thee about, and from this height
Back on the town direct thy sight.
Out of the hollow, gloomy gate,
The motley throngs come forth elate:
Each will the joy of the sunshine hoard,
To honor the Day of the Risen Lord!
They feel, themselves, their resurrection:
From the low, dark rooms, scarce habitable;
From the bonds of Work, from Trade's restriction;
From the pressing weight of roof and gable;
From the narrow, crushing streets and alleys;
From the churches' solemn and reverend night,
All come forth to the cheerful light.
How lively, see! the multitude sallies,
Scattering through gardens and fields remote,
While over the river, that broadly dallies,
Dances so many a festive boat;
And overladen, nigh to sinking,
The last full wherry takes the stream.
Yonder afar, from the hill-paths blinking,
Their clothes are colors that softly gleam.
I hear the noise of the village, even;
Here is the People's proper Heaven;
Here high and low contented see!
Here I am Man,--dare man to be!


WAGNER

To stroll with you, Sir Doctor, flatters;
'Tis honor, profit, unto me.
But I, alone, would shun these shallow matters,
Since all that's coarse provokes my enmity.
This fiddling, shouting, ten-pin rolling
I hate,--these noises of the throng:
They rave, as Satan were their sports controlling.
And call it mirth, and call it song!


PEASANTS, UNDER THE LINDEN-TREE
  (_Dance and Song_.)

          All for the dance the shepherd dressed,
          In ribbons, wreath, and gayest vest
            Himself with care arraying:
          Around the linden lass and lad
          Already footed it like mad:
            Hurrah! hurrah!
            Hurrah--tarara-la!
          The fiddle-bow was playing.

          He broke the ranks, no whit afraid,
          And with his elbow punched a maid,
            Who stood, the dance surveying:
          The buxom wench, she turned and said:
          "Now, you I call a stupid-head!"
            Hurrah! hurrah!
            Hurrah--tarara-la!
          "Be decent while you're staying!"

          Then round the circle went their flight,
          They danced to left, they danced to right:
          Their kirtles all were playing.
          They first grew red, and then grew warm,
          And rested, panting, arm in arm,--
            Hurrah! hurrah!
            Hurrah--tarara-la!
          And hips and elbows straying.

          Now, don't be so familiar here!
          How many a one has fooled his dear,
          Waylaying and betraying!

          And yet, he coaxed her soon aside,
          And round the linden sounded wide.
            Hurrah! hurrah!
            Hurrah--tarara-la!
          And the fiddle-bow was playing.

OLD PEASANT

Sir Doctor, it is good of you,
That thus you condescend, to-day,
Among this crowd of merry folk,
A highly-learned man, to stray.
Then also take the finest can,
We fill with fresh wine, for your sake:
I offer it, and humbly wish
That not alone your thirst is slake,--
That, as the drops below its brink,
So many days of life you drink!


FAUST

I take the cup you kindly reach,
With thanks and health to all and each.

(_The People gather in a circle about him_.)


OLD PEASANT

In truth, 'tis well and fitly timed,
That now our day of joy you share,
Who heretofore, in evil days,
Gave us so much of helping care.
Still many a man stands living here,
Saved by your father's skillful hand,
That snatched him from the fever's rage
And stayed the plague in all the land.
Then also you, though but a youth,
Went into every house of pain:
Many the corpses carried forth,
But you in health came out again.

FAUST

No test or trial you evaded:
A Helping God the helper aided.

ALL

Health to the man, so skilled and tried.
That for our help he long may abide!

FAUST

To Him above bow down, my friends,
Who teaches help, and succor sends!

(_He goes on with_ WAGNER.)

WAGNER

With what a feeling, thou great man, must thou
Receive the people's honest veneration!
How lucky he, whose gifts his station
With such advantages endow!
Thou'rt shown to all the younger generation:
Each asks, and presses near to gaze;
The fiddle stops, the dance delays.
Thou goest, they stand in rows to see,
And all the caps are lifted high;
A little more, and they would bend the knee
As if the Holy Host came by.

FAUST

A few more steps ascend, as far as yonder stone!--
Here from our wandering will we rest contented.
Here, lost in thought, I've lingered oft alone,
When foolish fasts and prayers my life tormented.
Here, rich in hope and firm in faith,
With tears, wrung hands and sighs, I've striven,
The end of that far-spreading death
Entreating from the Lord of Heaven!
Now like contempt the crowd's applauses seem:
Couldst thou but read, within mine inmost spirit,
How little now I deem,
That sire or son such praises merit!
My father's was a sombre, brooding brain,
Which through the holy spheres of Nature groped and wandered,
And honestly, in his own fashion, pondered
With labor whimsical, and pain:
Who, in his dusky work-shop bending,
With proved adepts in company,
Made, from his recipes unending,
Opposing substances agree.
There was a Lion red, a wooer daring,
Within the Lily's tepid bath espoused,
And both, tormented then by flame unsparing,
By turns in either bridal chamber housed.
If then appeared, with colors splendid,
The young Queen in her crystal shell,
This was the medicine--the patients' woes soon ended,
And none demanded: who got well?
Thus we, our hellish boluses compounding,
Among these vales and hills surrounding,
Worse than the pestilence, have passed.
Thousands were done to death from poison of my giving;
And I must hear, by all the living,
The shameless murderers praised at last!

WAGNER

Why, therefore, yield to such depression?
A good man does his honest share
In exercising, with the strictest care,
The art bequeathed to his possession!
Dost thou thy father honor, as a youth?
Then may his teaching cheerfully impel thee:
Dost thou, as man, increase the stores of truth?
Then may thine own son afterwards excel thee.

FAUST

O happy he, who still renews
The hope, from Error's deeps to rise forever!
That which one does not know, one needs to use;
And what one knows, one uses never.
But let us not, by such despondence, so
The fortune of this hour embitter!
Mark how, beneath the evening sunlight's glow,
The green-embosomed houses glitter!
The glow retreats, done is the day of toil;
It yonder hastes, new fields of life exploring;
Ah, that no wing can lift me from the soil,
Upon its track to follow, follow soaring!
Then would I see eternal Evening gild
The silent world beneath me glowing,
On fire each mountain-peak, with peace each valley filled,
The silver brook to golden rivers flowing.
The mountain-chain, with all its gorges deep,
Would then no more impede my godlike motion;
And now before mine eyes expands the ocean
With all its bays, in shining sleep!
Yet, finally, the weary god is sinking;
The new-born impulse fires my mind,--
I hasten on, his beams eternal drinking,
The Day before me and the Night behind,
Above me heaven unfurled, the floor of waves beneath me,--
A glorious dream! though now the glories fade.
Alas! the wings that lift the mind no aid
Of wings to lift the body can bequeath me.
Yet in each soul is born the pleasure
Of yearning onward, upward and away,
When o'er our heads, lost in the vaulted azure,
The lark sends down his flickering lay,--
When over crags and piny highlands
The poising eagle slowly soars,
And over plains and lakes and islands
The crane sails by to other shores.

WAGNER

I've had, myself, at times, some odd caprices,
But never yet such impulse felt, as this is.
One soon fatigues, on woods and fields to look,
Nor would I beg the bird his wing to spare us:
How otherwise the mental raptures bear us
From page to page, from book to book!
Then winter nights take loveliness untold,
As warmer life in every limb had crowned you;
And when your hands unroll some parchment rare and old,
All Heaven descends, and opens bright around you!

FAUST

One impulse art thou conscious of, at best;
O, never seek to know the other!
Two souls, alas! reside within my breast,
And each withdraws from, and repels, its brother.
One with tenacious organs holds in love
And clinging lust the world in its embraces;
The other strongly sweeps, this dust above,
Into the high ancestral spaces.
If there be airy spirits near,
'Twixt Heaven and Earth on potent errands fleeing,
Let them drop down the golden atmosphere,
And bear me forth to new and varied being!
Yea, if a magic mantle once were mine,
To waft me o'er the world at pleasure,
I would not for the costliest stores of treasure--
Not for a monarch's robe--the gift resign.

WAGNER

Invoke not thus the well-known throng,
Which through the firmament diffused is faring,
And danger thousand-fold, our race to wrong.
In every quarter is preparing.
Swift from the North the spirit-fangs so sharp
Sweep down, and with their barbéd points assail you;
Then from the East they come, to dry and warp
Your lungs, till breath and being fail you:
If from the Desert sendeth them the South,
With fire on fire your throbbing forehead crowning,
The West leads on a host, to cure the drouth
Only when meadow, field, and you are drowning.
They gladly hearken, prompt for injury,--
Gladly obey, because they gladly cheat us;
From Heaven they represent themselves to be,
And lisp like angels, when with lies they meet us.
But, let us go! 'Tis gray and dusky all:
The air is cold, the vapors fall.
At night, one learns his house to prize:--
Why stand you thus, with such astonished eyes?
What, in the twilight, can your mind so trouble?

FAUST

Seest thou the black dog coursing there, through corn and
stubble?

WAGNER

Long since: yet deemed him not important in the least.

FAUST

Inspect him close: for what tak'st thou the beast?

WAGNER

Why, for a poodle who has lost his master,
And scents about, his track to find.

FAUST

Seest thou the spiral circles, narrowing faster,
Which he, approaching, round us seems to wind?
A streaming trail of fire, if I see rightly,
Follows his path of mystery.

WAGNER

It may be that your eyes deceive you slightly;
Naught but a plain black poodle do I see.

FAUST

It seems to me that with enchanted cunning
He snares our feet, some future chain to bind.

WAGNER

I see him timidly, in doubt, around us running,
Since, in his master's stead, two strangers doth he find.

FAUST

The circle narrows: he is near!

WAGNER

A dog thou seest, and not a phantom, here!
Behold him stop--upon his belly crawl--His
tail set wagging: canine habits, all!

FAUST

Come, follow us! Come here, at least!

WAGNER

'Tis the absurdest, drollest beast.
Stand still, and you will see him wait;
Address him, and he gambols straight;
If something's lost, he'll quickly bring it,--
Your cane, if in the stream you fling it.

FAUST

No doubt you're right: no trace of mind, I own,
Is in the beast: I see but drill, alone.

WAGNER

The dog, when he's well educated,
Is by the wisest tolerated.
Yes, he deserves your favor thoroughly,--
The clever scholar of the students, he!

(_They pass in the city-gate_.)

III


THE STUDY

FAUST

(_Entering, with the poodle_.)

     Behind me, field and meadow sleeping,
     I leave in deep, prophetic night,
     Within whose dread and holy keeping
     The better soul awakes to light.
     The wild desires no longer win us,
     The deeds of passion cease to chain;
     The love of Man revives within us,
     The love of God revives again.

Be still, thou poodle; make not such racket and riot!
Why at the threshold wilt snuffing be?
Behind the stove repose thee in quiet!
My softest cushion I give to thee.
As thou, up yonder, with running and leaping
Amused us hast, on the mountain's crest,

So now I take thee into my keeping,
A welcome, but also a silent, guest.

     Ah, when, within our narrow chamber
     The lamp with friendly lustre glows,
     Flames in the breast each faded ember,
     And in the heart, itself that knows.
     Then Hope again lends sweet assistance,
     And Reason then resumes her speech:
     One yearns, the rivers of existence,
     The very founts of Life, to reach.

Snarl not, poodle! To the sound that rises,
The sacred tones that my soul embrace,
This bestial noise is out of place.
We are used to see, that Man despises
What he never comprehends,
And the Good and the Beautiful vilipends,
Finding them often hard to measure:
Will the dog, like man, snarl _his_ displeasure?

But ah! I feel, though will thereto be stronger,
Contentment flows from out my breast no longer.
Why must the stream so soon run dry and fail us,
And burning thirst again assail us?
Therein I've borne so much probation!
And yet, this want may be supplied us;
We call the Supernatural to guide us;
We pine and thirst for Revelation,
Which nowhere worthier is, more nobly sent,
Than here, in our New Testament.
I feel impelled, its meaning to determine,--
With honest purpose, once for all,
The hallowed Original
To change to my beloved German.

(_He opens a volume, and commences_.)
'Tis written: "In the Beginning was the _Word_."
Here am I balked: who, now can help afford?
The _Word?_--impossible so high to rate it;
And otherwise must I translate it.
If by the Spirit I am truly taught.
Then thus: "In the Beginning was the _Thought_"
This first line let me weigh completely,
Lest my impatient pen proceed too fleetly.
Is it the _Thought_ which works, creates, indeed?
"In the Beginning was the _Power,"_ I read.
Yet, as I write, a warning is suggested,
That I the sense may not have fairly tested.
The Spirit aids me: now I see the light!
"In the Beginning was the _Act_," I write.

If I must share my chamber with thee,
Poodle, stop that howling, prithee!
Cease to bark and bellow!
Such a noisy, disturbing fellow
I'll no longer suffer near me.
One of us, dost hear me!
Must leave, I fear me.
No longer guest-right I bestow;
The door is open, art free to go.
But what do I see in the creature?
Is that in the course of nature?
Is't actual fact? or Fancy's shows?
How long and broad my poodle grows!
He rises mightily:
A canine form that cannot be!
What a spectre I've harbored thus!
He resembles a hippopotamus,
With fiery eyes, teeth terrible to see:
O, now am I sure of thee!
For all of thy half-hellish brood
The Key of Solomon is good.

SPIRITS (_in the corridor_)

     Some one, within, is caught!
     Stay without, follow him not!
     Like the fox in a snare,
     Quakes the old hell-lynx there.
     Take heed--look about!
     Back and forth hover,
     Under and over,
     And he'll work himself out.
     If your aid avail him,
     Let it not fail him;
     For he, without measure,
     Has wrought for our pleasure.

FAUST

First, to encounter the beast,
The Words of the Four be addressed:
    Salamander, shine glorious!
    Wave, Undine, as bidden!
    Sylph, be thou hidden!
    Gnome, be laborious!

Who knows not their sense
(These elements),--
Their properties
And power not sees,--
No mastery he inherits
Over the Spirits.

     Vanish in flaming ether,
     Salamander!
     Flow foamingly together,
     Undine!
     Shine in meteor-sheen,
     Sylph!
     Bring help to hearth and shelf.
     Incubus! Incubus!
     Step forward, and finish thus!

Of the Four, no feature
Lurks in the creature.
Quiet he lies, and grins disdain:
Not yet, it seems, have I given him pain.
Now, to undisguise thee,
Hear me exorcise thee!
Art thou, my gay one,
Hell's fugitive stray-one?
The sign witness now,
Before which they bow,
The cohorts of Hell!

With hair all bristling, it begins to swell.

     Base Being, hearest thou?
     Knowest and fearest thou
     The One, unoriginate,
     Named inexpressibly,
     Through all Heaven impermeate,
     Pierced irredressibly!

Behind the stove still banned,
See it, an elephant, expand!
It fills the space entire,
Mist-like melting, ever faster.
'Tis enough: ascend no higher,--
Lay thyself at the feet of the Master!
Thou seest, not vain the threats I bring thee:
With holy fire I'll scorch and sting thee!
Wait not to know
The threefold dazzling glow!
Wait not to know
The strongest art within my hands!

MEPHISTOPHELES

(_while the vapor is dissipating, steps forth from behind the
stove, in the costume of a Travelling Scholar_.)
Why such a noise? What are my lord's commands?

FAUST

This was the poodle's real core,
A travelling scholar, then? The _casus_ is diverting.

MEPHISTOPHELES

The learned gentleman I bow before:
You've made me roundly sweat, that's certain!

FAUST

What is thy name?

MEPHISTOPHELES

A question small, it seems,
For one whose mind the Word so much despises;
Who, scorning all external gleams,
The depths of being only prizes.

FAUST

With all you gentlemen, the name's a test,
Whereby the nature usually is expressed.
Clearly the latter it implies
In names like Beelzebub, Destroyer, Father of Lies.
Who art thou, then?

MEPHISTOPHELES

Part of that Power, not understood,
Which always wills the Bad, and always works the Good.

FAUST

What hidden sense in this enigma lies?

MEPHISTOPHELES

I am the Spirit that Denies!
And justly so: for all things, from the Void
Called forth, deserve to be destroyed:
'Twere better, then, were naught created.
Thus, all which you as Sin have rated,--
Destruction,--aught with Evil blent,--
That is my proper element.

FAUST

Thou nam'st thyself a part, yet show'st complete to me?

MEPHISTOPHELES

The modest truth I speak to thee.
If Man, that microcosmic fool, can see
Himself a whole so frequently,
Part of the Part am I, once All, in primal Night,--
Part of the Darkness which brought forth the Light,
The haughty Light, which now disputes the space,
And claims of Mother Night her ancient place.
And yet, the struggle fails; since Light, howe'er it weaves,
Still, fettered, unto bodies cleaves:
It flows from bodies, bodies beautifies;
By bodies is its course impeded;
And so, but little time is needed,
I hope, ere, as the bodies die, it dies!

FAUST

I see the plan thou art pursuing:
Thou canst not compass general ruin,
And hast on smaller scale begun.

MEPHISTOPHELES

And truly 'tis not much, when all is done.
That which to Naught is in resistance set,--
The Something of this clumsy world,--has yet,
With all that I have undertaken,
Not been by me disturbed or shaken:
From earthquake, tempest, wave, volcano's brand,
Back into quiet settle sea and land!
And that damned stuff, the bestial, human brood,--
What use, in having that to play with?
How many have I made away with!
And ever circulates a newer, fresher blood.
It makes me furious, such things beholding:
From Water, Earth, and Air unfolding,
A thousand germs break forth and grow,
In dry, and wet, and warm, and chilly;
And had I not the Flame reserved, why, really,
There's nothing special of my own to show!

FAUST

So, to the actively eternal
Creative force, in cold disdain
You now oppose the fist infernal,
Whose wicked clench is all in vain!
Some other labor seek thou rather,
Queer Son of Chaos, to begin!

MEPHISTOPHELES

Well, we'll consider: thou canst gather
My views, when next I venture in.
Might I, perhaps, depart at present?

FAUST

Why thou shouldst ask, I don't perceive.
Though our acquaintance is so recent,
For further visits thou hast leave.
The window's here, the door is yonder;
A chimney, also, you behold.

MEPHISTOPHELES

I must confess that forth I may not wander,
My steps by one slight obstacle controlled,--
The wizard's-foot, that on your threshold made is.

FAUST

The pentagram prohibits thee?
Why, tell me now, thou Son of Hades,
If that prevents, how cam'st thou in to me?
Could such a spirit be so cheated?

MEPHISTOPHELES

Inspect the thing: the drawing's not completed.
The outer angle, you may see,
Is open left--the lines don't fit it.

FAUST

Well,--Chance, this time, has fairly hit it!
And thus, thou'rt prisoner to me?
It seems the business has succeeded.

MEPHISTOPHELES

The poodle naught remarked, as after thee he speeded;
But other aspects now obtain:
The Devil can't get out again.

FAUST

Try, then, the open window-pane!

MEPHISTOPHELES

For Devils and for spectres this is law:
Where they have entered in, there also they withdraw.
The first is free to us; we're governed by the second.

FAUST

In Hell itself, then, laws are reckoned?
That's well! So might a compact be
Made with you gentlemen--and binding,--surely?

MEPHISTOPHELES

All that is promised shall delight thee purely;
No skinflint bargain shalt thou see.
But this is not of swift conclusion;
We'll talk about the matter soon.
And now, I do entreat this boon--
Leave to withdraw from my intrusion.

FAUST

One moment more I ask thee to remain,
Some pleasant news, at least, to tell me.

MEPHISTOPHELES

Release me, now! I soon shall come again;
Then thou, at will, mayst question and compel me.

FAUST

I have not snares around thee cast;
Thyself hast led thyself into the meshes.
Who traps the Devil, hold him fast!
Not soon a second time he'll catch a prey so precious.

MEPHISTOPHELES

An't please thee, also I'm content to stay,
And serve thee in a social station;
But stipulating, that I may
With arts of mine afford thee recreation.

FAUST

Thereto I willingly agree,
If the diversion pleasant be.

MEPHISTOPHELES

My friend, thou'lt win, past all pretences,
More in this hour to soothe thy senses,
Than in the year's monotony.
That which the dainty spirits sing thee,
The lovely pictures they shall bring thee,
Are more than magic's empty show.
Thy scent will be to bliss invited;
Thy palate then with taste delighted,
Thy nerves of touch ecstatic glow!
All unprepared, the charm I spin:
We're here together, so begin!

SPIRITS

     Vanish, ye darking
     Arches above him!
     Loveliest weather,
     Born of blue ether,
     Break from the sky!
     O that the darkling
     Clouds had departed!
     Starlight is sparkling,
     Tranquiller-hearted
     Suns are on high.
     Heaven's own children
     In beauty bewildering,
     Waveringly bending,
     Pass as they hover;
     Longing unending
     Follows them over.
     They, with their glowing
     Garments, out-flowing,
     Cover, in going,
     Landscape and bower,
     Where, in seclusion,
     Lovers are plighted,
     Lost in illusion.
     Bower on bower!
     Tendrils unblighted!
     Lo! in a shower
     Grapes that o'ercluster
     Gush into must, or
     Flow into rivers
     Of foaming and flashing
     Wine, that is dashing
     Gems, as it boundeth
     Down the high places,
     And spreading, surroundeth
     With crystalline spaces,
     In happy embraces,
     Blossoming forelands,
     Emerald shore-lands!
     And the winged races
     Drink, and fly onward--
     Fly ever sunward
     To the enticing
     Islands, that flatter,
     Dipping and rising
     Light on the water!
     Hark, the inspiring
     Sound of their quiring!
     See, the entrancing
     Whirl of their dancing!
     All in the air are
     Freer and fairer.
     Some of them scaling
     Boldly the highlands,
     Others are sailing,
     Circling the islands;
     Others are flying;
     Life-ward all hieing,--
     All for the distant
     Star of existent
     Rapture and Love!

MEPHISTOPHELES

He sleeps! Enough, ye fays! your airy number
Have sung him truly into slumber:
For this performance I your debtor prove.--
Not yet art thou the man, to catch the Fiend and hold him!--
With fairest images of dreams infold him,
Plunge him in seas of sweet untruth!
Yet, for the threshold's magic which controlled him,
The Devil needs a rat's quick tooth.
I use no lengthened invocation:
Here rustles one that soon will work my liberation.

The lord of rats and eke of mice,
Of flies and bed-bugs, frogs and lice,
Summons thee hither to the door-sill,
To gnaw it where, with just a morsel
Of oil, he paints the spot for thee:--
There com'st thou, hopping on to me!
To work, at once! The point which made me craven
Is forward, on the ledge, engraven.
Another bite makes free the door:
So, dream thy dreams, O Faust, until we meet once more!

FAUST _(awaking)_

Am I again so foully cheated?
Remains there naught of lofty spirit-sway,
But that a dream the Devil counterfeited,
And that a poodle ran away?

THE STUDY

FAUST MEPHISTOPHELES

FAUST

A knock? Come in! Again my quiet broken?

MEPHISTOPHELES

'Tis I!

FAUST

         Come in!

MEPHISTOPHELES

                  Thrice must the words be spoken.

FAUST

Come in, then!


MEPHISTOPHELES

                   Thus thou pleasest me.
I hope we'll suit each other well;
For now, thy vapors to dispel,
I come, a squire of high degree,
In scarlet coat, with golden trimming,
A cloak in silken lustre swimming,
A tall cock's-feather in my hat,
A long, sharp sword for show or quarrel,--
And I advise thee, brief and flat,
To don the self-same gay apparel,
That, from this den released, and free,
Life be at last revealed to thee!

FAUST

This life of earth, whatever my attire,
Would pain me in its wonted fashion.
Too old am I to play with passion;
Too young, to be without desire.
What from the world have I to gain?
Thou shalt abstain--renounce--refrain!
Such is the everlasting song
That in the ears of all men rings,--
That unrelieved, our whole life long,
Each hour, in passing, hoarsely sings.
In very terror I at morn awake,
Upon the verge of bitter weeping,
To see the day of disappointment break,
To no one hope of mine--not one--its promise keeping:--
That even each joy's presentiment
With wilful cavil would diminish,
With grinning masks of life prevent
My mind its fairest work to finish!
Then, too, when night descends, how anxiously
Upon my couch of sleep I lay me:
There, also, comes no rest to me,
But some wild dream is sent to fray me.
The God that in my breast is owned
Can deeply stir the inner sources;
The God, above my powers enthroned,
He cannot change external forces.
So, by the burden of my days oppressed,
Death is desired, and Life a thing unblest!

MEPHISTOPHELES

And yet is never Death a wholly welcome guest.

FAUST

O fortunate, for whom, when victory glances,
The bloody laurels on the brow he bindeth!
Whom, after rapid, maddening dances,
In clasping maiden-arms he findeth!
O would that I, before that spirit-power,
Ravished and rapt from life, had sunken!

MEPHISTOPHELES

And yet, by some one, in that nightly hour,
A certain liquid was not drunken.

FAUST

Eavesdropping, ha! thy pleasure seems to be.

MEPHISTOPHELES

Omniscient am I not; yet much is known to me.

FAUST

Though some familiar tone, retrieving
My thoughts from torment, led me on,
And sweet, clear echoes came, deceiving
A faith bequeathed from Childhood's dawn,
Yet now I curse whate'er entices
And snares the soul with visions vain;
With dazzling cheats and dear devices
Confines it in this cave of pain!
Cursed be, at once, the high ambition
Wherewith the mind itself deludes!
Cursed be the glare of apparition
That on the finer sense intrudes!
Cursed be the lying dream's impression
Of name, and fame, and laurelled brow!
Cursed, all that flatters as possession,
As wife and child, as knave and plow!
Cursed Mammon be, when he with treasures
To restless action spurs our fate!
Cursed when, for soft, indulgent leisures,
He lays for us the pillows straight!
Cursed be the vine's transcendent nectar,--
The highest favor Love lets fall!
Cursed, also, Hope!--cursed Faith, the spectre!
And cursed be Patience most of all!

CHORUS OF SPIRITS (_invisible_)

     Woe! woe!
     Thou hast it destroyed,
     The beautiful world,
     With powerful fist:
     In ruin 'tis hurled,
     By the blow of a demigod shattered!
     The scattered
     Fragments into the Void we carry,
     Deploring
     The beauty perished beyond restoring.
     Mightier
     For the children of men,
     Brightlier
     Build it again,
     In thine own bosom build it anew!
     Bid the new career
     Commence,
     With clearer sense,
     And the new songs of cheer
     Be sung thereto!

MEPHISTOPHELES

These are the small dependants
Who give me attendance.
Hear them, to deeds and passion
Counsel in shrewd old-fashion!
Into the world of strife,
Out of this lonely life
That of senses and sap has betrayed thee,
They would persuade thee.
This nursing of the pain forego thee,
That, like a vulture, feeds upon thy breast!
The worst society thou find'st will show thee
Thou art a man among the rest.
But 'tis not meant to thrust
Thee into the mob thou hatest!
I am not one of the greatest,
Yet, wilt thou to me entrust
Thy steps through life, I'll guide thee,--
Will willingly walk beside thee,--
Will serve thee at once and forever
With best endeavor,
And, if thou art satisfied,
Will as servant, slave, with thee abide.

FAUST

And what shall be my counter-service therefor?

MEPHISTOPHELES

The time is long: thou need'st not now insist.

FAUST

No--no! The Devil is an egotist,
And is not apt, without a why or wherefore,
"For God's sake," others to assist.
Speak thy conditions plain and clear!
With such a servant danger comes, I fear.

MEPHISTOPHELES

_Here_, an unwearied slave, I'll wear thy tether,
And to thine every nod obedient be:
When _There_ again we come together,
Then shalt thou do the same for me.

FAUST

The _There_ my scruples naught increases.
When thou hast dashed this world to pieces,
The other, then, its place may fill.
Here, on this earth, my pleasures have their sources;
Yon sun beholds my sorrows in his courses;
And when from these my life itself divorces,
Let happen all that can or will!
I'll hear no more: 'tis vain to ponder
If there we cherish love or hate,
Or, in the spheres we dream of yonder,
A High and Low our souls await.

MEPHISTOPHELES

In this sense, even, canst thou venture.
Come, bind thyself by prompt indenture,
And thou mine arts with joy shalt see:
What no man ever saw, I'll give to thee.

FAUST

Canst thou, poor Devil, give me whatsoever?
When was a human soul, in its supreme endeavor,
E'er understood by such as thou?
Yet, hast thou food which never satiates, now,--
The restless, ruddy gold hast thou,
That runs, quicksilver-like, one's fingers through,--
A game whose winnings no man ever knew,--
A maid that, even from my breast,
Beckons my neighbor with her wanton glances,
And Honor's godlike zest,
The meteor that a moment dances,--
Show me the fruits that, ere they're gathered, rot,
And trees that daily with new leafage clothe them!

MEPHISTOPHELES

Such a demand alarms me not:
Such treasures have I, and can show them.
But still the time may reach us, good my friend.
When peace we crave and more luxurious diet.

FAUST

When on an idler's bed I stretch myself in quiet.
There let, at once, my record end!
Canst thou with lying flattery rule me,
Until, self-pleased, myself I see,--
Canst thou with rich enjoyment fool me,
Let that day be the last for me!
The bet I offer.

MEPHISTOPHELES
                   Done!

FAUST
                         And heartily!
When thus I hail the Moment flying:
"Ah, still delay--thou art so fair!"
Then bind me in thy bonds undying,
My final ruin then declare!
Then let the death-bell chime the token.
Then art thou from thy service free!
The clock may stop, the hand be broken,
Then Time be finished unto me!

MEPHISTOPHELES

Consider well: my memory good is rated.

FAUST

Thou hast a perfect right thereto.
My powers I have not rashly estimated:
A slave am I, whate'er I do--
If thine, or whose? 'tis needless to debate it.

MEPHISTOPHELES

Then at the Doctors'-banquet I, to-day,
Will as a servant wait behind thee.
But one thing more! Beyond all risk to bind thee,
Give me a line or two, I pray.

FAUST

Demand'st thou, Pedant, too, a document?
Hast never known a man, nor proved his word's intent?
Is't not enough, that what I speak to-day
Shall stand, with all my future days agreeing?
In all its tides sweeps not the world away,
And shall a promise bind my being?
Yet this delusion in our hearts we bear:
Who would himself therefrom deliver?
Blest he, whose bosom Truth makes pure and fair!
No sacrifice shall he repent of ever.
Nathless a parchment, writ and stamped with care,
A spectre is, which all to shun endeavor.
The word, alas! dies even in the pen,
And wax and leather keep the lordship then.
What wilt from me, Base Spirit, say?--
Brass, marble, parchment, paper, clay?
The terms with graver, quill, or chisel, stated?
I freely leave the choice to thee.

MEPHISTOPHELES

Why heat thyself, thus instantly,
With eloquence exaggerated?
Each leaf for such a pact is good;
And to subscribe thy name thou'lt take a drop of blood.

FAUST

If thou therewith art fully satisfied,
So let us by the farce abide.

MEPHISTOPHELES

Blood is a juice of rarest quality.

FAUST

Fear not that I this pact shall seek to sever?
The promise that I make to thee
Is just the sum of my endeavor.
I have myself inflated all too high;
My proper place is thy estate:
The Mighty Spirit deigns me no reply,
And Nature shuts on me her gate.
The thread of Thought at last is broken,
And knowledge brings disgust unspoken.
Let us the sensual deeps explore,
To quench the fervors of glowing passion!
Let every marvel take form and fashion
Through the impervious veil it wore!
Plunge we in Time's tumultuous dance,
In the rush and roll of Circumstance!
Then may delight and distress,
And worry and success,
Alternately follow, as best they can:
Restless activity proves the man!

MEPHISTOPHELES

For you no bound, no term is set.
Whether you everywhere be trying,
Or snatch a rapid bliss in flying,
May it agree with you, what you get!
Only fall to, and show no timid balking.

FAUST

But thou hast heard, 'tis not of joy we're talking.
I take the wildering whirl, enjoyment's keenest pain,
Enamored hate, exhilarant disdain.
My bosom, of its thirst for knowledge sated,
Shall not, henceforth, from any pang be wrested,
And all of life for all mankind created
Shall be within mine inmost being tested:
The highest, lowest forms my soul shall borrow,
Shall heap upon itself their bliss and sorrow,
And thus, my own sole self to all their selves expanded,
I too, at last, shall with them all be stranded!

MEPHISTOPHELES

Believe me, who for many a thousand year
The same tough meat have chewed and tested,
That from the cradle to the bier
No man the ancient leaven has digested!
Trust one of us, this Whole supernal
Is made but for a God's delight!
_He_ dwells in splendor single and eternal,
But _us_ he thrusts in darkness, out of sight,
And _you_ he dowers with Day and Night.

FAUST

Nay, but I will!

MEPHISTOPHELES

A good reply!
One only fear still needs repeating:
The art is long, the time is fleeting.
Then let thyself be taught, say I!
Go, league thyself with a poet,
Give the rein to his imagination,
Then wear the crown, and show it,
Of the qualities of his creation,--
The courage of the lion's breed,
The wild stag's speed,
The Italian's fiery blood,
The North's firm fortitude!
Let him find for thee the secret tether
That binds the Noble and Mean together.
And teach thy pulses of youth and pleasure
To love by rule, and hate by measure!
I'd like, myself, such a one to see:
Sir Microcosm his name should be.

FAUST

What am I, then, if 'tis denied my part
The crown of all humanity to win me,
Whereto yearns every sense within me?

MEPHISTOPHELES

Why, on the whole, thou'rt--what thou art.
Set wigs of million curls upon thy head, to raise thee,
Wear shoes an ell in height,--the truth betrays thee,
And thou remainest--what thou art.

FAUST

I feel, indeed, that I have made the treasure
Of human thought and knowledge mine, in vain;
And if I now sit down in restful leisure,
No fount of newer strength is in my brain:
I am no hair's-breadth more in height,
Nor nearer, to the Infinite,

MEPHISTOPHELES

Good Sir, you see the facts precisely
As they are seen by each and all.
We must arrange them now, more wisely,
Before the joys of life shall pall.
Why, Zounds! Both hands and feet are, truly--
And head and virile forces--thine:
Yet all that I indulge in newly,
Is't thence less wholly mine?
If I've six stallions in my stall,
Are not their forces also lent me?
I speed along, completest man of all,
As though my legs were four-and-twenty.
Take hold, then! let reflection rest,
And plunge into the world with zest!
I say to thee, a speculative wight
Is like a beast on moorlands lean,
That round and round some fiend misleads to evil plight,
While all about lie pastures fresh and green.

FAUST

Then how shall we begin?

MEPHISTOPHELES

We'll try a wider sphere.
What place of martyrdom is here!
Is't life, I ask, is't even prudence,
To bore thyself and bore the students?
Let Neighbor Paunch to that attend!
Why plague thyself with threshing straw forever?
The best thou learnest, in the end
Thou dar'st not tell the youngsters--never!
I hear one's footsteps, hither steering.

FAUST
To see him now I have no heart.

MEPHISTOPHELES

So long the poor boy waits a hearing,
He must not unconsoled depart.
Thy cap and mantle straightway lend me!
I'll play the comedy with art.

(_He disguises himself_.)

My wits, be certain, will befriend me.
But fifteen minutes' time is all I need;
For our fine trip, meanwhile, prepare thyself with speed!

[_Exit_ FAUST.

MEPHISTOPHELES

(_In_ FAUST'S _long mantle_.)

Reason and Knowledge only thou despise,
The highest strength in man that lies!
Let but the Lying Spirit bind thee
With magic works and shows that blind thee,
And I shall have thee fast and sure!--
Fate such a bold, untrammelled spirit gave him,
As forwards, onwards, ever must endure;
Whose over-hasty impulse drave him
Past earthly joys he might secure.
Dragged through the wildest life, will I enslave him,
Through flat and stale indifference;
With struggling, chilling, checking, so deprave him
That, to his hot, insatiate sense,
The dream of drink shall mock, but never lave him:
Refreshment shall his lips in vain implore--
Had he not made himself the Devil's, naught could save
him,
Still were he lost forevermore!

(_A_ STUDENT _enters_.)

STUDENT

A short time, only, am I here,
And come, devoted and sincere,
To greet and know the man of fame,
Whom men to me with reverence name.

MEPHISTOPHELES

Your courtesy doth flatter me:
You see a man, as others be.
Have you, perchance, elsewhere begun?

STUDENT

Receive me now, I pray, as one
Who comes to you with courage good,
Somewhat of cash, and healthy blood:
My mother was hardly willing to let me;
But knowledge worth having I fain would get me.

MEPHISTOPHELES

Then you have reached the right place now.

STUDENT

I'd like to leave it, I must avow;
I find these walls, these vaulted spaces
Are anything but pleasant places.
Tis all so cramped and close and mean;
One sees no tree, no glimpse of green,
And when the lecture-halls receive me,
Seeing, hearing, and thinking leave me.

MEPHISTOPHELES

All that depends on habitude.
So from its mother's breasts a child
At first, reluctant, takes its food,
But soon to seek them is beguiled.
Thus, at the breasts of Wisdom clinging,
Thou'lt find each day a greater rapture bringing.

STUDENT

I'll hang thereon with joy, and freely drain them;
But tell me, pray, the proper means to gain them.

MEPHISTOPHELES

Explain, before you further speak,
The special faculty you seek.

STUDENT

I crave the highest erudition;
And fain would make my acquisition
All that there is in Earth and Heaven,
In Nature and in Science too.

MEPHISTOPHELES

Here is the genuine path for you;
Yet strict attention must be given.

STUDENT

Body and soul thereon I'll wreak;
Yet, truly, I've some inclination
On summer holidays to seek
A little freedom and recreation.

MEPHISTOPHELES

Use well your time! It flies so swiftly from us;
But time through order may be won, I promise.
So, Friend (my views to briefly sum),
First, the _collegium logicum_.
There will your mind be drilled and braced,
As if in Spanish boots 'twere laced,
And thus, to graver paces brought,
'Twill plod along the path of thought,
Instead of shooting here and there,
A will-o'-the-wisp in murky air.
Days will be spent to bid you know,
What once you did at a single blow,
Like eating and drinking, free and strong,--
That one, two, three! thereto belong.
Truly the fabric of mental fleece
Resembles a weaver's masterpiece,
Where a thousand threads one treadle throws,
Where fly the shuttles hither and thither.
Unseen the threads are knit together.
And an infinite combination grows.
Then, the philosopher steps in
And shows, no otherwise it could have been:
The first was so, the second so,
Therefore the third and fourth are so;
Were not the first and second, then
The third and fourth had never been.
The scholars are everywhere believers,
But never succeed in being weavers.
He who would study organic existence,
First drives out the soul with rigid persistence;
Then the parts in his hand he may hold and class,
But the spiritual link is lost, alas!
_Encheiresin natures_, this Chemistry names,
Nor knows how herself she banters and blames!

STUDENT

I cannot understand you quite.

MEPHISTOPHELES

Your mind will shortly be set aright,
When you have learned, all things reducing,
To classify them for your using.

STUDENT

I feel as stupid, from all you've said,
As if a mill-wheel whirled in my head!

MEPHISTOPHELES

And after--first and foremost duty--Of
Metaphysics learn the use and beauty!
See that you most profoundly gain
What does not suit the human brain!
A splendid word to serve, you'll find
For what goes in--or won't go in--your mind.
But first, at least this half a year,
To order rigidly adhere;
Five hours a day, you understand,
And when the clock strikes, be on hand!
Prepare beforehand for your part
With paragraphs all got by heart,
So you can better watch, and look
That naught is said but what is in the book:
Yet in thy writing as unwearied be,
As did the Holy Ghost dictate to thee!

STUDENT

No need to tell me twice to do it!
I think, how useful 'tis to write;
For what one has, in black and white,
One carries home and then goes through it.

MEPHISTOPHELES

Yet choose thyself a faculty!

STUDENT

I cannot reconcile myself to Jurisprudence.

MEPHISTOPHELES

Nor can I therefore greatly blame you students:
I know what science this has come to be.
All rights and laws are still transmitted
Like an eternal sickness of the race,--
From generation unto generation fitted,
And shifted round from place to place.
Reason becomes a sham, Beneficence a worry:
Thou art a grandchild, therefore woe to thee!
The right born with us, ours in verity,
This to consider, there's, alas! no hurry.

STUDENT

My own disgust is strengthened by your speech:
O lucky he, whom you shall teach!
I've almost for Theology decided.

MEPHISTOPHELES

I should not wish to see you here misguided:
For, as regards this science, let me hint
'Tis very hard to shun the false direction;
There's so much secret poison lurking in 't,
So like the medicine, it baffles your detection.
Hear, therefore, one alone, for that is best, in sooth,
And simply take your master's words for truth.
On _words_ let your attention centre!
Then through the safest gate you'll enter
The temple-halls of Certainty.

STUDENT

Yet in the word must some idea be.

MEPHISTOPHELES

Of course! But only shun too over-sharp a tension,
For just where fails the comprehension,
A word steps promptly in as deputy.
With words 'tis excellent disputing;
Systems to words 'tis easy suiting;
On words 'tis excellent believing;
No word can ever lose a jot from thieving.

STUDENT

Pardon! With many questions I detain you.
Yet must I trouble you again.
Of Medicine I still would fain
Hear one strong word that might explain you.
Three years is but a little space.
And, God! who can the field embrace?
If one some index could be shown,
'Twere easier groping forward, truly.

MEPHISTOPHELES (_aside_)

I'm tired enough of this dry tone,--
Must play the Devil again, and fully.

(_Aloud_)

To grasp the spirit of Medicine is easy:
Learn of the great and little world your fill,
To let it go at last, so please ye,
Just as God will!
In vain that through the realms of science you may drift;
Each one learns only--just what learn he can:
Yet he who grasps the Moment's gift,
He is the proper man.
Well-made you are, 'tis not to be denied,
The rest a bold address will win you;
If you but in yourself confide,
At once confide all others in you.
To lead the women, learn the special feeling!
Their everlasting aches and groans,
In thousand tones,
Have all one source, one mode of healing;
And if your acts are half discreet,
You'll always have them at your feet.
A title first must draw and interest them,
And show that yours all other arts exceeds;
Then, as a greeting, you are free to touch and test them,
While, thus to do, for years another pleads.
You press and count the pulse's dances,
And then, with burning sidelong glances,
You clasp the swelling hips, to see
If tightly laced her corsets be.

STUDENT

That's better, now! The How and Where, one sees.

MEPHISTOPHELES

My worthy friend, gray are all theories,
And green alone Life's golden tree.

STUDENT

I swear to you, 'tis like a dream to me.
Might I again presume, with trust unbounded,
To hear your wisdom thoroughly expounded?

MEPHISTOPHELES

Most willingly, to what extent I may.

STUDENT

I cannot really go away:
Allow me that my album first I reach you,--
Grant me this favor, I beseech you!

MEPHISTOPHELES

Assuredly.

(_He writes, and returns the book_.)

STUDENT (_reads_)

_Eritis sicut Deus, scientes bonum et malum_.
(_Closes the book with reverence, and withdraws_)

MEPHISTOPHELES

Follow the ancient text, and the snake thou wast ordered to trample!
With all thy likeness to God, thou'lt yet be a sorry example!

(FAUST _enters_.)

FAUST

Now, whither shall we go?

MEPHISTOPHELES

As best it pleases thee.
The little world, and then the great, we'll see.
With what delight, what profit winning,
Shalt thou sponge through the term beginning!

FAUST

Yet with the flowing beard I wear,
Both ease and grace will fail me there.
The attempt, indeed, were a futile strife;
I never could learn the ways of life.
I feel so small before others, and thence
Should always find embarrassments.

MEPHISTOPHELES

My friend, thou soon shalt lose all such misgiving:
Be thou but self-possessed, thou hast the art of living!

FAUST

How shall we leave the house, and start?
Where hast thou servant, coach and horses?

MEPHISTOPHELES

We'll spread this cloak with proper art,
Then through the air direct our courses.
But only, on so bold a flight,
Be sure to have thy luggage light.
A little burning air, which I shall soon prepare us,
Above the earth will nimbly bear us,
And, if we're light, we'll travel swift and clear:
I gratulate thee on thy new career!

AUERBACH'S CELLAR IN LEIPZIG
CAROUSAL OF JOLLY COMPANIONS

FROSCH

Is no one laughing? no one drinking?
I'll teach you how to grin, I'm thinking.
To-day you're like wet straw, so tame;
And usually you're all aflame.

BRANDER

Now that's your fault; from you we nothing see,
No beastliness and no stupidity.

FROSCH

(_Pours a glass of wine over_ BRANDER'S _head_.)
There's both together!

BRANDER

Twice a swine!

FROSCH

You wanted them: I've given you mine.

SIEBEL

Turn out who quarrels--out the door!
With open throat sing chorus, drink and roar!
Up! holla! ho!

ALTMAYER

Woe's me, the fearful bellow!
Bring cotton, quick! He's split my ears, that fellow.

SIEBEL

When the vault echoes to the song,
One first perceives the bass is deep and strong.

FROSCH

Well said! and out with him that takes the least offence!
_Ah, tara, lara da_!

ALTMAYER

_Ah, tara, lara, da_!

FROSCH

The throats are tuned, commence!
(_Sings_.)
_The dear old holy Roman realm,
How does it hold together_?

BRANDER

A nasty song! Fie! a political song--
A most offensive song! Thank God, each morning, therefore,
That you have not the Roman realm to care for!
At least, I hold it so much gain for me,
That I nor Chancellor nor Kaiser be.
Yet also we must have a ruling head, I hope,
And so we'll choose ourselves a Pope.
You know the quality that can
Decide the choice, and elevate the man.

FROSCH (_sings_)

     _Soar up, soar up, Dame Nightingale!
     Ten thousand times my sweetheart hail!_

SIEBEL

No, greet my sweetheart not! I tell you, I'll resent it.

FROSCH

My sweetheart greet and kiss! I dare you to prevent it!

            (_Sings_.)

     _Draw the latch! the darkness makes:
     Draw the latch! the lover wakes.
     Shut the latch! the morning breaks_.

SIEBEL

Yes, sing away, sing on, and praise, and brag of her!
I'll wait my proper time for laughter:
Me by the nose she led, and now she'll lead you after.
Her paramour should be an ugly gnome,
Where four roads cross, in wanton play to meet her:
An old he-goat, from Blocksberg coming home,
Should his good-night in lustful gallop bleat her!
A fellow made of genuine flesh and blood
Is for the wench a deal too good.
Greet her? Not I: unless, when meeting,
To smash her windows be a greeting!

BRANDER (_pounding on the table_)

Attention! Hearken now to me!
Confess, Sirs, I know how to live.
Enamored persons here have we,
And I, as suits their quality,
Must something fresh for their advantage give.
Take heed! 'Tis of the latest cut, my strain,
And all strike in at each refrain!

     (_He sings_.)

     There was a rat in the cellar-nest,
     Whom fat and butter made smoother:
     He had a paunch beneath his vest
     Like that of Doctor Luther.
     The cook laid poison cunningly,
     And then as sore oppressed was he
     As if he had love in his bosom.

     CHORUS (_shouting_)

     As if he had love in his bosom!

     BRANDER

     He ran around, he ran about,
     His thirst in puddles laving;
     He gnawed and scratched the house throughout.
     But nothing cured his raving.
     He whirled and jumped, with torment mad,
     And soon enough the poor beast had,
     As if he had love in his bosom.

     CHORUS

     As if he had love in his bosom!

     BRANDER

     And driven at last, in open day,
     He ran into the kitchen,
     Fell on the hearth, and squirming lay,
     In the last convulsion twitching.
     Then laughed the murderess in her glee:
     "Ha! ha! he's at his last gasp," said she,
     "As if he had love in his bosom!"

CHORUS

     As if he had love in his bosom!

SIEBEL

How the dull fools enjoy the matter!
To me it is a proper art
Poison for such poor rats to scatter.

BRANDER

Perhaps you'll warmly take their part?

ALTMAYER

The bald-pate pot-belly I have noted:
Misfortune tames him by degrees;
For in the rat by poison bloated
His own most natural form he sees.

FAUST AND MEPHISTOPHELES

MEPHISTOPHELES

Before all else, I bring thee hither
Where boon companions meet together,
To let thee see how smooth life runs away.
Here, for the folk, each day's a holiday:
With little wit, and ease to suit them,
They whirl in narrow, circling trails,
Like kittens playing with their tails?
And if no headache persecute them,
So long the host may credit give,
They merrily and careless live.

BRANDER

The fact is easy to unravel,
Their air's so odd, they've just returned from travel:
A single hour they've not been here.

FROSCH

You've verily hit the truth! Leipzig to me is dear:
Paris in miniature, how it refines its people!

SIEBEL

Who are the strangers, should you guess?

FROSCH

Let me alone! I'll set them first to drinking,
And then, as one a child's tooth draws, with cleverness,
I'll worm their secret out, I'm thinking.
They're of a noble house, that's very clear:
Haughty and discontented they appear.

BRANDER

They're mountebanks, upon a revel.

ALTMAYER

Perhaps.

FROSCH

Look out, I'll smoke them now!

MEPHISTOPHELES (_to_ FAUST)

Not if he had them by the neck, I vow,
Would e'er these people scent the Devil!

FAUST
Fair greeting, gentlemen!

SIEBEL

Our thanks: we give the same.
(_Murmurs, inspecting_ MEPHISTOPHELES _from the side_.)
In one foot is the fellow lame?

MEPHISTOPHELES

Is it permitted that we share your leisure?
In place of cheering drink, which one seeks vainly here,
Your company shall give us pleasure.

ALTMAYER

A most fastidious person you appear.


FROSCH

No doubt 'twas late when you from Rippach started?
And supping there with Hans occasioned your delay?

MEPHISTOPHELES

We passed, without a call, to-day.
At our last interview, before we parted
Much of his cousins did he speak, entreating
That we should give to each his kindly greeting.

(_He bows to_ FROSCH.)

ALTMAYER (_aside_)

You have it now! he understands.

SIEBEL

A knave sharp-set!

FROSCH

Just wait awhile: I'll have him yet.

MEPHISTOPHELES

If I am right, we heard the sound
Of well-trained voices, singing chorus;
And truly, song must here rebound
Superbly from the arches o'er us.

FROSCH

Are you, perhaps, a virtuoso?

MEPHISTOPHELES

O no! my wish is great, my power is only so-so.

ALTMAYER

Give us a song!

MEPHISTOPHELES

If you desire, a number.

SIEBEL

So that it be a bran-new strain!

MEPHISTOPHELES

We've just retraced our way from. Spain,
The lovely land of wine, and song, and slumber.

(_Sings_.)

There was a king once reigning,
Who had a big black flea--

FROSCH

Hear, hear! A flea! D'ye rightly take the jest?
I call a flea a tidy guest.

MEPHISTOPHELES (_sings_)

     There was a king once reigning,
     Who had a big black flea,
     And loved him past explaining,
     As his own son were he.
     He called his man of stitches;
     The tailor came straightway:
     Here, measure the lad for breeches.
     And measure his coat, I say!

BRANDER

But mind, allow the tailor no caprices:
Enjoin upon him, as his head is dear,
To most exactly measure, sew and shear,
So that the breeches have no creases!

MEPHISTOPHELES

     In silk and velvet gleaming
     He now was wholly drest--
     Had a coat with ribbons streaming,
     A cross upon his breast.
     He had the first of stations,
     A minister's star and name;
     And also all his relations
     Great lords at court became.

     And the lords and ladies of honor
     Were plagued, awake and in bed;
     The queen she got them upon her,
     The maids were bitten and bled.
     And they did not dare to brush them,
     Or scratch them, day or night:
     We crack them and we crush them,
     At once, whene'er they bite.

     CHORUS (_shouting_)

     We crack them and we crush them,
     At once, whene'er they bite!

FROSCH
Bravo! bravo! that was fine.

SIEBEL

Every flea may it so befall!

BRANDER

Point your fingers and nip them all!

ALTMAYER

Hurrah for Freedom! Hurrah for wine!

MEPHISTOPHELES

I fain would drink with you, my glass to Freedom clinking,
If 'twere a better wine that here I see you drinking.

SIEBEL

Don't let us hear that speech again!

MEPHISTOPHELES

Did I not fear the landlord might complain,
I'd treat these worthy guests, with pleasure,
To some from out our cellar's treasure.

SIEBEL

Just treat, and let the landlord me arraign!

FROSCH

And if the wine be good, our praises shall be ample.
But do not give too very small a sample;
For, if its quality I decide,
With a good mouthful I must be supplied.

ALTMAYER (_aside_)

They're from the Rhine! I guessed as much, before.

MEPHISTOPHELES

Bring me a gimlet here!

BRANDER

What shall therewith be done?
You've not the casks already at the door?

ALTMAYER

Yonder, within the landlord's box of tools, there's one!

MEPHISTOPHELES (_takes the gimlet_)

(_To_ FROSCH.)

Now, give me of your taste some intimation.

FROSCH

How do you mean? Have you so many kinds?

MEPHISTOPHELES

The choice is free: make up your minds.

ALTMAYER (_to_ FROSCH)

Aha! you lick your chops, from sheer anticipation.

FROSCH

Good! if I have the choice, so let the wine be Rhenish!
Our Fatherland can best the sparkling cup replenish.

MEPHISTOPHELES

(_boring a hole in the edge of the table, at the place where_
FROSCH _sits_)

Get me a little wax, to make the stoppers, quick!

ALTMAYER

Ah! I perceive a juggler's trick.

MEPHISTOPHELES (_to_ BRANDER)

And you?

BRANDER

Champagne shall be my wine,
And let it sparkle fresh and fine!

MEPHISTOPHELES

(_bores: in the meantime one has made the wax stoppers, and
plugged the holes with them_.)

BRANDER

What's foreign one can't always keep quite clear of,
For good things, oft, are not so near;
A German can't endure the French to see or hear of,
Yet drinks their wines with hearty cheer.

SIEBEL

(_as_ MEPHISTOPHELES _approaches his seat_)
For me, I grant, sour wine is out of place;
Fill up my glass with sweetest, will you?

MEPHISTOPHELES (_boring_)

Tokay shall flow at once, to fill you!

ALTMAYER

No--look me, Sirs, straight in the face!
I see you have your fun at our expense.

MEPHISTOPHELES

O no! with gentlemen of such pretence,
That were to venture far, indeed.
Speak out, and make your choice with speed!
With what a vintage can I serve you?

ALTMAYER

With any--only satisfy our need.

(_After the holes have been bored and plugged_)

MEPHISTOPHELES (_with singular gestures_)

     Grapes the vine-stem bears,
     Horns the he-goat wears!
     The grapes are juicy, the vines are wood,
     The wooden table gives wine as good!
     Into the depths of Nature peer,--
     Only believe there's a miracle here!

Now draw the stoppers, and drink your fill!

ALL

(_as they draw out the stoppers, and the wine which has been
desired flows into the glass of each)_

O beautiful fountain, that flows at will!

MEPHISTOPHELES

But have a care that you nothing spill!

(_They drink repeatedly_.)

ALL (_sing_)

     As 'twere five hundred hogs, we feel
     So cannibalic jolly!

MEPHISTOPHELES

See, now, the race is happy--it is free!

FAUST

To leave them is my inclination.

MEPHISTOPHELES

Take notice, first! their bestiality
Will make a brilliant demonstration.

SIEBEL

(_drinks carelessly: the wine spills upon the earth, and turns to
flame_)

Help! Fire! Help! Hell-fire is sent!

MEPHISTOPHELES (_charming away the flame)_

Be quiet, friendly element!

(_To the revellers_)

A bit of purgatory 'twas for this time, merely.

SIEBEL

What mean you? Wait!--you'll pay for't dearly!
You'll know us, to your detriment.

FROSCH

Don't try that game a second time upon us!

ALTMAYER

I think we'd better send him packing quietly.

SIEBEL

What, Sir! you dare to make so free,
And play your hocus-pocus on us!

MEPHISTOPHELES

Be still, old wine-tub.

SIEBEL

Broomstick, you!
You face it out, impertinent and heady?

BRANDER

Just wait! a shower of blows is ready.

ALTMAYER

(_draws a stopper out of the table: fire flies in his face_.)
I burn! I burn!

SIEBEL

'Tis magic! Strike--
The knave is outlawed! Cut him as you like!
(_They draw their knives, and rush upon_ MEPHISTOPHELES.)

MEPHISTOPHELES (_with solemn gestures_)

     False word and form of air,
     Change place, and sense ensnare!
     Be here--and there!

(_They stand amazed and look at each other_.)

ALTMAYER

Where am I? What a lovely land!

FROSCH

Vines? Can I trust my eyes?

SIEBEL

And purple grapes at hand!

BRANDER

Here, over this green arbor bending,
See what a vine! what grapes depending!

(_He takes_ SIEBEL _by the nose: the others do the same reciprocally,
and raise their knives_.)

MEPHISTOPHELES (_as above_)

Loose, Error, from their eyes the band,
And how the Devil jests, be now enlightened!

(_He disappears with_ FAUST: _the revellers start and separate_.)

SIEBEL

What happened?

ALTMAYER

How?

FROSCH

Was that your nose I tightened?

BRANDER (_to_ SIEBEL)

And yours that still I have in hand?

ALTMAYER

It was a blow that went through every limb!
Give me a chair! I sink! my senses swim.

FROSCH

But what has happened, tell me now?

SIEBEL

Where is he? If I catch the scoundrel hiding,
He shall not leave alive, I vow.

ALTMAYER

I saw him with these eyes upon a wine-cask riding
Out of the cellar-door, just now.
Still in my feet the fright like lead is weighing.
(_He turns towards the table_.)
Why! If the fount of wine should still be playing?

SIEBEL

'Twas all deceit, and lying, false design!

FROSCH

And yet it seemed as I were drinking wine.

BRANDER

But with the grapes how was it, pray?

ALTMAYER

Shall one believe no miracles, just say!

VI


WITCHES' KITCHEN

(_Upon a low hearth stands a great caldron, under which a fire
is burning. Various figures appear in the vapors which
rise from the caldron. An ape sits beside it, skims it, and
watches lest it boil over. The he-ape, with the young
ones, sits near and warms himself. Ceiling and walls are
covered with the most fantastic witch-implements_.)

FAUST MEPHISTOPHELES

FAUST

These crazy signs of witches' craft repel me!
I shall recover, dost thou tell me,
Through this insane, chaotic play?
From an old hag shall I demand assistance?
And will her foul mess take away
Full thirty years from my existence?
Woe's me, canst thou naught better find!
Another baffled hope must be lamented:
Has Nature, then, and has a noble mind
Not any potent balsam yet invented?

MEPHISTOPHELES

Once more, my friend, thou talkest sensibly.
There is, to make thee young, a simpler mode and apter;
But in another book 'tis writ for thee,
And is a most eccentric chapter.

FAUST

Yet will I know it.

MEPHISTOPHELES

Good! the method is revealed
Without or gold or magic or physician.
Betake thyself to yonder field,
There hoe and dig, as thy condition;
Restrain thyself, thy sense and will
Within a narrow sphere to flourish;
With unmixed food thy body nourish;
Live with the ox as ox, and think it not a theft
That thou manur'st the acre which thou reapest;--
That, trust me, is the best mode left,
Whereby for eighty years thy youth thou keepest!

FAUST

I am not used to that; I cannot stoop to try it--
To take the spade in hand, and ply it.
The narrow being suits me not at all.

MEPHISTOPHELES

Then to thine aid the witch must call.

FAUST

Wherefore the hag, and her alone?
Canst thou thyself not brew the potion?

MEPHISTOPHELES

That were a charming sport, I own:
I'd build a thousand bridges meanwhile, I've a notion.
Not Art and Science serve, alone;
Patience must in the work be shown.
Long is the calm brain active in creation;
Time, only, strengthens the fine fermentation.
And all, belonging thereunto,
Is rare and strange, howe'er you take it:
The Devil taught the thing, 'tis true,
And yet the Devil cannot make it.
(_Perceiving the Animals_)
See, what a delicate race they be!
That is the maid! the man is he!
(_To the Animals_)
It seems the mistress has gone away?

THE ANIMALS

Carousing, to-day!
Off and about,
By the chimney out!

MEPHISTOPHELES

What time takes she for dissipating?

THE ANIMALS

While we to warm our paws are waiting.

MEPHISTOPHELES (_to_ FAUST)

How findest thou the tender creatures?

FAUST

Absurder than I ever yet did see.

MEPHISTOPHELES

Why, just such talk as this, for me,
Is that which has the most attractive features!

(_To the Animals_)

But tell me now, ye cursed puppets,
Why do ye stir the porridge so?

THE ANIMALS

We're cooking watery soup for beggars.

MEPHISTOPHELES

Then a great public you can show.

THE HE-APE

(_comes up and fawns on_ MEPHISTOPHELES)

     O cast thou the dice!
     Make me rich in a trice,
     Let me win in good season!
     Things are badly controlled,
     And had I but gold,
     So had I my reason.

MEPHISTOPHELES

How would the ape be sure his luck enhances.
Could he but try the lottery's chances!

(_In the meantime the young apes have been playing with a
large ball, which they now roll forward_.)

THE HE-APE

     The world's the ball:
     Doth rise and fall,
     And roll incessant:
     Like glass doth ring,
     A hollow thing,--
     How soon will't spring,
     And drop, quiescent?
     Here bright it gleams,
     Here brighter seems:
     I live at present!
     Dear son, I say,
     Keep thou away!
     Thy doom is spoken!
     'Tis made of clay,
     And will be broken.

MEPHISTOPHELES

What means the sieve?

THE HE-APE (_taking it down_)

     Wert thou the thief,
     I'd know him and shame him.

(_He runs to the_ SHE-APE, _and lets her look through it_.)

     Look through the sieve!
     Know'st thou the thief,
     And darest not name him?

MEPHISTOPHELES (_approaching the fire)_

And what's this pot?

HE-APE AND SHE-APE

     The fool knows it not!
     He knows not the pot,
     He knows not the kettle!

MEPHISTOPHELES

Impertinent beast!

THE HE-APE

Take the brush here, at least,
And sit down on the settle!

(_He invites_ MEPHISTOPHELES _to sit down_.)

FAUST

(_who during all this time has been standing before a mirror,
now approaching and now retreating from it_)

What do I see? What heavenly form revealed
Shows through the glass from Magic's fair dominions!
O lend me, Love, the swiftest of thy pinions,
And bear me to her beauteous field!
Ah, if I leave this spot with fond designing,
If I attempt to venture near,
Dim, as through gathering mist, her charms appear!--
A woman's form, in beauty shining!
Can woman, then, so lovely be?
And must I find her body, there reclining,
Of all the heavens the bright epitome?
Can Earth with such a thing be mated?

MEPHISTOPHELES

Why, surely, if a God first plagues Himself six days,
Then, self-contented, _Bravo_! says,
Must something clever be created.
This time, thine eyes be satiate!
I'll yet detect thy sweetheart and ensnare her,
And blest is he, who has the lucky fate,
Some day, as bridegroom, home to bear her.

(FAUST _gazes continually in the mirror_. MEPHISTOPHELES,
_stretching himself out on the settle, and playing with the
brush, continues to speak_.)

So sit I, like the King upon his throne:
I hold the sceptre, here,--and lack the crown alone.

THE ANIMALS

(_who up to this time have been making all kinds of fantastic
movements together bring a crown to_ MEPHISTOPHELES
_with great noise_.)

     O be thou so good
     With sweat and with blood
     The crown to belime!

(_They handle the crown awkwardly and break it into two
pieces, with which they spring around_.)

     'Tis done, let it be!
     We speak and we see,
     We hear and we rhyme!

FAUST (_before the mirror_)

Woe's me! I fear to lose my wits.

MEPHISTOPHELES (_pointing to the Animals_)

My own head, now, is really nigh to sinking.

THE ANIMALS

     If lucky our hits,
     And everything fits,
     'Tis thoughts, and we're thinking!

FAUST (_as above_)

My bosom burns with that sweet vision;
Let us, with speed, away from here!

MEPHISTOPHELES (_in the same attitude_)

One must, at least, make this admission--
They're poets, genuine and sincere.

(_The caldron, which the_ SHE-APE _has up to this time neglected
to watch, begins to boil over: there ensues a great flame_,
_which blazes out the chimney. The_ WITCH _comes careering
down through the flame, with terrible cries_.)

THE WITCH

     Ow! ow! ow! ow!
     The damnéd beast--the curséd sow!
     To leave the kettle, and singe the Frau!
     Accurséd fere!

(_Perceiving_ FAUST _and_ MEPHISTOPHELES.)

     What is that here?
     Who are you here?
     What want you thus?
     Who sneaks to us?
     The fire-pain
     Burn bone and brain!

(_She plunges the skimming-ladle into the caldron, and scatters
flames towards_ FAUST, MEPHISTOPHELES, _and the Animals.
The Animals whimper_.)

MEPHISTOPHELES

(_reversing the brush, which he has been holding in his hand,
and striding among the jars and glasses_)

     In two! in two!
     There lies the brew!
     There lies the glass!
     The joke will pass,
     As time, foul ass!
     To the singing of thy crew.

(_As the_ WITCH _starts back, full of wrath and horror_)

Ha! know'st thou me? Abomination, thou!
Know'st thou, at last, thy Lord and Master?
What hinders me from smiting now
Thee and thy monkey-sprites with fell disaster?
Hast for the scarlet coat no reverence?
Dost recognize no more the tall cock's-feather?
Have I concealed this countenance?--
Must tell my name, old face of leather?

THE WITCH

O pardon, Sir, the rough salute!
Yet I perceive no cloven foot;
And both your ravens, where are _they_ now?

MEPHISTOPHELES

This time, I'll let thee 'scape the debt;
For since we two together met,
'Tis verily full many a day now.
Culture, which smooth the whole world licks,
Also unto the Devil sticks.
The days of that old Northern phantom now are over:
Where canst thou horns and tail and claws discover?
And, as regards the foot, which I can't spare, in truth,
'Twould only make the people shun me;
Therefore I've worn, like many a spindly youth,
False calves these many years upon me.

THE WITCH (_dancing_)

Reason and sense forsake my brain,
Since I behold Squire Satan here again!

MEPHISTOPHELES

Woman, from such a name refrain!

THE WITCH

Why so? What has it done to thee?

MEPHISTOPHELES

It's long been written in the Book of Fable;
Yet, therefore, no whit better men we see:
The Evil One has left, the evil ones are stable.
Sir Baron call me thou, then is the matter good;
A cavalier am I, like others in my bearing.
Thou hast no doubt about my noble blood:
See, here's the coat-of-arms that I am wearing!

(_He makes an indecent gesture_.)

THE WITCH (_laughs immoderately_)

Ha! ha! That's just your way, I know:
A rogue you are, and you were always so.

MEPHISTOPHELES (_to_ FAUST)

My friend, take proper heed, I pray!
To manage witches, this is just the way.

THE WITCH

Wherein, Sirs, can I be of use?

MEPHISTOPHELES

Give us a goblet of the well-known juice!
But, I must beg you, of the oldest brewage;
The years a double strength produce.

THE WITCH

With all my heart! Now, here's a bottle,
Wherefrom, sometimes, I wet my throttle,
Which, also, not the slightest, stinks;
And willingly a glass I'll fill him.

(_Whispering_)

Yet, if this man without due preparation drinks,
As well thou know'st, within an hour 'twill kill him.

MEPHISTOPHELES

He is a friend of mine, with whom it will agree,
And he deserves thy kitchen's best potation:
Come, draw thy circle, speak thine adjuration,
And fill thy goblet full and free!

THE WITCH

(_with fantastic gestures draws a circle and places mysterious
articles therein; meanwhile the glasses begin to ring, the
caldron to sound, and make a musical accompaniment.
Finally she brings a great book, and stations in the circle
the Apes, who are obliged to serve as reading-desk, and to
hold the torches. She then beckons_ FAUST _to approach_.)

FAUST (_to_ MEPHISTOPHELES)

Now, what shall come of this? the creatures antic,
The crazy stuff, the gestures frantic,--
All the repulsive cheats I view,--
Are known to me, and hated, too.

MEPHISTOPHELES

O, nonsense! That's a thing for laughter;
Don't be so terribly severe!
She juggles you as doctor now, that, after,
The beverage may work the proper cheer.

(_He persuades_ FAUST _to step into the circle_.)

THE WITCH

(_begins to declaim, with much emphasis, from the book_)

     See, thus it's done!
     Make ten of one,
     And two let be,
     Make even three,
     And rich thou 'It be.
     Cast o'er the four!
     From five and six
     (The witch's tricks)
     Make seven and eight,
     'Tis finished straight!
     And nine is one,
     And ten is none.
     This is the witch's once-one's-one!

FAUST

She talks like one who raves in fever.

MEPHISTOPHELES

Thou'lt hear much more before we leave her.
'Tis all the same: the book I can repeat,
Such time I've squandered o'er the history:
A contradiction thus complete
Is always for the wise, no less than fools, a mystery.
The art is old and new, for verily
All ages have been taught the matter,--
By Three and One, and One and Three,
Error instead of Truth to scatter.
They prate and teach, and no one interferes;
All from the fellowship of fools are shrinking.
Man usually believes, if only words he hears,
That also with them goes material for thinking!

THE WITCH (_continues_)

     The lofty skill
     Of Science, still
     From all men deeply hidden!
     Who takes no thought,
     To him 'tis brought,
     'Tis given unsought, unbidden!

FAUST

What nonsense she declaims before us!
My head is nigh to split, I fear:
It seems to me as if I hear
A hundred thousand fools in chorus.

MEPHISTOPHELES

O Sibyl excellent, enough of adjuration!
But hither bring us thy potation,
And quickly fill the beaker to the brim!
This drink will bring my friend no injuries:
He is a man of manifold degrees,
And many draughts are known to him.

(_The_ WITCH, _with many ceremonies, pours the drink into a
cup; as_ FAUST _sets it to his lips, a light flame arises_.)

Down with it quickly! Drain it off!
'Twill warm thy heart with new desire:
Art with the Devil hand and glove,
And wilt thou be afraid of fire?

(_The_ WITCH _breaks the circle_: FAUST _steps forth_.)

MEPHISTOPHELES

And now, away! Thou dar'st not rest.

THE WITCH

And much good may the liquor do thee!

MEPHISTOPHELES (_to the_ WITCH)

Thy wish be on Walpurgis Night expressed;
What boon I have, shall then be given unto thee.

THE WITCH

Here is a song, which, if you sometimes sing,
You'll find it of peculiar operation.

MEPHISTOPHELES (_to_ FAUST)

Come, walk at once! A rapid occupation
Must start the needful perspiration,
And through thy frame the liquor's potence fling.
The noble indolence I'll teach thee then to treasure,
And soon thou'lt be aware, with keenest thrills of pleasure,
How Cupid stirs and leaps, on light and restless wing.

FAUST

One rapid glance within the mirror give me,
How beautiful that woman-form!

MEPHISTOPHELES

No, no! The paragon of all, believe me,
Thou soon shalt see, alive and warm.

_(Aside)_

Thou'lt find, this drink thy blood compelling,
Each woman beautiful as Helen!

STREET

FAUST MARGARET _(passing by)_

FAUST

Fair lady, let it not offend you,
That arm and escort I would lend you!

MARGARET

I'm neither lady, neither fair,
And home I can go without your care.

[_She releases herself, and exit_.

FAUST

By Heaven, the girl is wondrous fair!
Of all I've seen, beyond compare;
So sweetly virtuous and pure,
And yet a little pert, be sure!
The lip so red, the cheek's clear dawn,
[Illustration:]
I'll not forget while the world rolls on!
How she cast down her timid eyes,
Deep in my heart imprinted lies:
How short and sharp of speech was she,
Why, 'twas a real ecstasy!

(MEPHISTOPHELES _enters_)

FAUST

Hear, of that girl I'd have possession!

MEPHISTOPHELES

Which, then?

FAUST

The one who just went by.

MEPHISTOPHELES

She, there? She's coming from confession,
Of every sin absolved; for I,
Behind her chair, was listening nigh.
So innocent is she, indeed,
That to confess she had no need.
I have no power o'er souls so green.

FAUST

And yet, she's older than fourteen.

MEPHISTOPHELES

How now! You're talking like Jack Rake,
Who every flower for himself would take,
And fancies there are no favors more,
Nor honors, save for him in store;
Yet always doesn't the thing succeed.

FAUST

Most Worthy Pedagogue, take heed!
Let not a word of moral law be spoken!
I claim, I tell thee, all my right;
And if that image of delight
Rest not within mine arms to-night,
At midnight is our compact broken.

MEPHISTOPHELES

But think, the chances of the case!
I need, at least, a fortnight's space,
To find an opportune occasion.

FAUST

Had I but seven hours for all,
I should not on the Devil call,
But win her by my own persuasion.

MEPHISTOPHELES

You almost like a Frenchman prate;
Yet, pray, don't take it as annoyance!
Why, all at once, exhaust the joyance?
Your bliss is by no means so great
As if you'd use, to get control,
All sorts of tender rigmarole,
And knead and shape her to your thought,
As in Italian tales 'tis taught.

FAUST

Without that, I have appetite.

MEPHISTOPHELES

But now, leave jesting out of sight!
I tell you, once for all, that speed
With this fair girl will not succeed;
By storm she cannot captured be;
We must make use of strategy.

FAUST

Get me something the angel keeps!
Lead me thither where she sleeps!
Get me a kerchief from her breast,--
A garter that her knee has pressed!

MEPHISTOPHELES

That you may see how much I'd fain
Further and satisfy your pain,
We will no longer lose a minute;
I'll find her room to-day, and take you in it.

FAUST

And shall I see--possess her?

MEPHISTOPHELES

No!
Unto a neighbor she must go,
And meanwhile thou, alone, mayst glow
With every hope of future pleasure,
Breathing her atmosphere in fullest measure.

FAUST

Can we go thither?

MEPHISTOPHELES

'Tis too early yet.

FAUST

A gift for her I bid thee get!
[_Exit_.

MEPHISTOPHELES

Presents at once? That's good: he's certain to get at her!
Full many a pleasant place I know,
And treasures, buried long ago:
I must, perforce, look up the matter. _[Exit_.
[Illustration]




VIII


EVENING A SMALL, NEATLY KEPT CHAMBER

MARGARET

(_plaiting and binding up the braids of her hair_)

I'd something give, could I but say
Who was that gentleman, to-day.
Surely a gallant man was he,
And of a noble family;
And much could I in his face behold,--
And he wouldn't, else, have been so bold!

                              [_Exit_

MEPHISTOPHELES FAUST

MEPHISTOPHELES

Come in, but gently: follow me!

FAUST (_after a moment's silence_)

Leave me alone, I beg of thee!

MEPHISTOPHELES (_prying about_)

Not every girl keeps things so neat.

FAUST (_looking around_)

O welcome, twilight soft and sweet,
That breathes throughout this hallowed shrine!
Sweet pain of love, bind thou with fetters fleet
The heart that on the dew of hope must pine!
How all around a sense impresses
Of quiet, order, and content!
This poverty what bounty blesses!
What bliss within this narrow den is pent!

(_He throws himself into a leathern arm-chair near the bed_.)

Receive me, thou, that in thine open arms
Departed joy and pain wert wont to gather!
How oft the children, with their ruddy charms,
Hung here, around this throne, where sat the father!
Perchance my love, amid the childish band,
Grateful for gifts the Holy Christmas gave her,
Here meekly kissed the grandsire's withered hand.
I feel, O maid! thy very soul
Of order and content around me whisper,--
Which leads thee with its motherly control,
The cloth upon thy board bids smoothly thee unroll,
The sand beneath thy feet makes whiter, crisper.
O dearest hand, to thee 'tis given
To change this hut into a lower heaven!
And here!

(_He lifts one of the bed-curtains_.)

What sweetest thrill is in my blood!
Here could I spend whole hours, delaying:
Here Nature shaped, as if in sportive playing,
The angel blossom from the bud.
Here lay the child, with Life's warm essence
The tender bosom filled and fair,
And here was wrought, through holier, purer presence,
The form diviner beings wear!

And I? What drew me here with power?
How deeply am I moved, this hour!
What seek I? Why so full my heart, and sore?
Miserable Faust! I know thee now no more.

Is there a magic vapor here?
I came, with lust of instant pleasure,
And lie dissolved in dreams of love's sweet leisure!
Are we the sport of every changeful atmosphere?

And if, this moment, came she in to me,
How would I for the fault atonement render!
How small the giant lout would be,
Prone at her feet, relaxed and tender!

MEPHISTOPHELES

Be quick! I see her there, returning.

FAUST

Go! go! I never will retreat.

MEPHISTOPHELES

Here is a casket, not unmeet,
Which elsewhere I have just been earning.
Here, set it in the press, with haste!
I swear, 'twill turn her head, to spy it:
Some baubles I therein had placed,
That you might win another by it.
True, child is child, and play is play.

FAUST

I know not, should I do it?

MEPHISTOPHELES

Ask you, pray?
Yourself, perhaps, would keep the bubble?
Then I suggest, 'twere fair and just
To spare the lovely day your lust,
And spare to me the further trouble.
You are not miserly, I trust?
I rub my hands, in expectation tender--

(_He places the casket in the press, and locks it again_.)

Now quick, away!
The sweet young maiden to betray,
So that by wish and will you bend her;
And you look as though
To the lecture-hall you were forced to go,--
As if stood before you, gray and loath,
Physics and Metaphysics both!
But away! [_Exeunt_.

MARGARET (_with a lamp_)

It is so close, so sultry, here!

(_She opens the window_)

And yet 'tis not so warm outside.
I feel, I know not why, such fear!--
Would mother came!--where can she bide?
My body's chill and shuddering,--
I'm but a silly, fearsome thing!

(_She begins to sing while undressing_)

        There was a King in Thule,
        Was faithful till the grave,--
        To whom his mistress, dying,
        A golden goblet gave.

        Naught was to him more precious;
        He drained it at every bout:
        His eyes with tears ran over,
        As oft as he drank thereout.

        When came his time of dying,
        The towns in his land he told,
        Naught else to his heir denying
        Except the goblet of gold.

        He sat at the royal banquet
        With his knights of high degree,
        In the lofty hall of his fathers
        In the Castle by the Sea.

        There stood the old carouser,
        And drank the last life-glow;
        And hurled the hallowed goblet
        Into the tide below.

        He saw it plunging and filling,
        And sinking deep in the sea:
        Then fell his eyelids forever,
        And never more drank he!

(_She opens the press in order to arrange her clothes, and perceives
the casket of jewels_.)

How comes that lovely casket here to me?
I locked the press, most certainly.
'Tis truly wonderful! What can within it be?
Perhaps 'twas brought by some one as a pawn,
And mother gave a loan thereon?
And here there hangs a key to fit:
I have a mind to open it.
What is that? God in Heaven! Whence came
Such things? Never beheld I aught so fair!
Rich ornaments, such as a noble dame
On highest holidays might wear!
How would the pearl-chain suit my hair?
Ah, who may all this splendor own?

(_She adorns herself with the jewelry, and steps before the
mirror_.)

Were but the ear-rings mine, alone!
One has at once another air.
What helps one's beauty, youthful blood?
One may possess them, well and good;
But none the more do others care.
They praise us half in pity, sure:
To gold still tends,
On gold depends
All, all! Alas, we poor!

PROMENADE

(FAUST, _walking thoughtfully up and down. To him_ MEPHISTOPHELES.)

MEPHISTOPHELES

By all love ever rejected! By hell-fire hot and unsparing!
I wish I knew something worse, that I might use it for
swearing!

FAUST

What ails thee? What is't gripes thee, elf?
A face like thine beheld I never.

MEPHISTOPHELES

I would myself unto the Devil deliver,
If I were not a Devil myself!

FAUST

Thy head is out of order, sadly:
It much becomes thee to be raving madly.

MEPHISTOPHELES

Just think, the pocket of a priest should get
The trinkets left for Margaret!
The mother saw them, and, instanter,
A secret dread began to haunt her.
Keen scent has she for tainted air;
She snuffs within her book of prayer,
And smells each article, to see
If sacred or profane it be;
So here she guessed, from every gem,
That not much blessing came with them.
"My child," she said, "ill-gotten good
Ensnares the soul, consumes the blood.
Before the Mother of God we'll lay it;
With heavenly manna she'll repay it!"
But Margaret thought, with sour grimace,
"A gift-horse is not out of place,
And, truly! godless cannot be
The one who brought such things to me."
A parson came, by the mother bidden:
He saw, at once, where the game was hidden,
And viewed it with a favor stealthy.
He spake: "That is the proper view,--
Who overcometh, winneth too.
The Holy Church has a stomach healthy:
Hath eaten many a land as forfeit,
And never yet complained of surfeit:
The Church alone, beyond all question,
Has for ill-gotten goods the right digestion."

FAUST

A general practice is the same,
Which Jew and King may also claim.

MEPHISTOPHELES

Then bagged the spangles, chains, and rings,
As if but toadstools were the things,
And thanked no less, and thanked no more
Than if a sack of nuts he bore,--
Promised them fullest heavenly pay,
And deeply edified were they.

FAUST

And Margaret?

MEPHISTOPHELES

Sits unrestful still,
And knows not what she should, or will;
Thinks on the jewels, day and night,
But more on him who gave her such delight.

FAUST

The darling's sorrow gives me pain.
Get thou a set for her again!
The first was not a great display.

MEPHISTOPHELES

O yes, the gentleman finds it all child's-play!

FAUST

Fix and arrange it to my will;
And on her neighbor try thy skill!
Don't be a Devil stiff as paste,
But get fresh jewels to her taste!

MEPHISTOPHELES

Yes, gracious Sir, in all obedience!

[_Exit_ FAUST.

Such an enamored fool in air would blow
Sun, moon, and all the starry legions,
To give his sweetheart a diverting show.

[_Exit_.

THE NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE

MARTHA (_solus_)

God forgive my husband, yet he
Hasn't done his duty by me!
Off in the world he went straightway,--
Left me lie in the straw where I lay.
And, truly, I did naught to fret him:
God knows I loved, and can't forget him!

(_She weeps_.)

Perhaps he's even dead! Ah, woe!--
Had I a certificate to show!

MARGARET (_comes_)

Dame Martha!

MARTHA

Margaret! what's happened thee?

MARGARET

I scarce can stand, my knees are trembling!
I find a box, the first resembling,
Within my press! Of ebony,--
And things, all splendid to behold,
And richer far than were the old.

MARTHA

You mustn't tell it to your mother!
'Twould go to the priest, as did the other.

MARGARET

Ah, look and see--just look and see!

MARTHA (_adorning her_)

O, what a blessed luck for thee!

MARGARET

But, ah! in the streets I dare not bear them,
Nor in the church be seen to wear them.

MARTHA

Yet thou canst often this way wander,
And secretly the jewels don,
Walk up and down an hour, before the mirror yonder,--
We'll have our private joy thereon.
And then a chance will come, a holiday,
When, piece by piece, can one the things abroad display,
A chain at first, then other ornament:
Thy mother will not see, and stories we'll invent.

MARGARET

Whoever could have brought me things so precious?
That something's wrong, I feel suspicious.

(_A knock_)

Good Heaven! My mother can that have been?

MARTHA (_peeping through the blind_)

'Tis some strange gentleman.--Come in!

(MEPHISTOPHELES _enters_.)


MEPHISTOPHELES

That I so boldly introduce me,
I beg you, ladies, to excuse me.

(_Steps back reverently, on seeing_ MARGARET.)

For Martha Schwerdtlein I'd inquire!


MARTHA

I'm she: what does the gentleman desire?


MEPHISTOPHELES (_aside to her_)

It is enough that you are she:
You've a visitor of high degree.
Pardon the freedom I have ta'en,--
Will after noon return again.


MARTHA (_aloud_)

Of all things in the world! Just hear--
He takes thee for a lady, dear!


MARGARET

I am a creature young and poor:
The gentleman's too kind, I'm sure.
The jewels don't belong to me.


MEPHISTOPHELES

Ah, not alone the jewelry!
The look, the manner, both betray--
Rejoiced am I that I may stay!


MARTHA

What is your business? I would fain--

MEPHISTOPHELES

I would I had a more cheerful strain!
Take not unkindly its repeating:
Your husband's dead, and sends a greeting.


MARTHA

Is dead? Alas, that heart so true!
My husband dead! Let me die, too!


MARGARET

Ah, dearest dame, let not your courage fail!


MEPHISTOPHELES

Hear me relate the mournful tale!


MARGARET

Therefore I'd never love, believe me!
A loss like this to death would grieve me.


MEPHISTOPHELES

Joy follows woe, woe after joy comes flying.


MARTHA

Relate his life's sad close to me!


MEPHISTOPHELES

In Padua buried, he is lying
Beside the good Saint Antony,
Within a grave well consecrated,
For cool, eternal rest created.


MARTHA

He gave you, further, no commission?

MEPHISTOPHELES

Yes, one of weight, with many sighs:
Three hundred masses buy, to save him from perdition!
My hands are empty, otherwise.


MARTHA

What! Not a pocket-piece? no jewelry?
What every journeyman within his wallet spares,
And as a token with him bears,
And rather starves or begs, than loses?


MEPHISTOPHELES

Madam, it is a grief to me;
Yet, on my word, his cash was put to proper uses.
Besides, his penitence was very sore,
And he lamented his ill fortune all the more.


MARGARET

Alack, that men are so unfortunate!
Surely for his soul's sake full many a prayer I'll proffer.


MEPHISTOPHELES

You well deserve a speedy marriage-offer:
You are so kind, compassionate.


MARGARET

O, no! As yet, it would not do.


MEPHISTOPHELES

If not a husband, then a beau for you!
It is the greatest heavenly blessing,
To have a dear thing for one's caressing.


MARGARET

The country's custom is not so.

MEPHISTOPHELES

Custom, or not! It happens, though.


MARTHA

Continue, pray!


MEPHISTOPHELES

  I stood beside his bed of dying.
'Twas something better than manure,--
Half-rotten straw: and yet, he died a Christian, sure,
And found that heavier scores to his account were lying.
He cried: "I find my conduct wholly hateful!
To leave my wife, my trade, in manner so ungrateful!
Ah, the remembrance makes me die!
Would of my wrong to her I might be shriven!"


MARTHA (_weeping_)

The dear, good man! Long since was he forgiven.


MEPHISTOPHELES

"Yet she, God knows! was more to blame than I."


MARTHA

He lied! What! On the brink of death he slandered?


MEPHISTOPHELES

In the last throes his senses wandered,
If I such things but half can judge.
He said: "I had no time for play, for gaping freedom:
First children, and then work for bread to feed 'em,--
For bread, in the widest sense, to drudge,
And could not even eat my share in peace and quiet!"


MARTHA

Had he all love, all faith forgotten in his riot?
My work and worry, day and night?

MEPHISTOPHELES

Not so: the memory of it touched him quite.
Said he: "When I from Malta went away
My prayers for wife and little ones were zealous,
And such a luck from Heaven befell us,
We made a Turkish merchantman our prey,
That to the Soldan bore a mighty treasure.
Then I received, as was most fit,
Since bravery was paid in fullest measure,
My well-apportioned share of it."


MARTHA

Say, how? Say, where? If buried, did he own it?


MEPHISTOPHELES

Who knows, now, whither the four winds have blown it?
A fair young damsel took him in her care,
As he in Naples wandered round, unfriended;
And she much love, much faith to him did bear,
So that he felt it till his days were ended.


MARTHA

The villain! From his children thieving!
Even all the misery on him cast
Could not prevent his shameful way of living!


MEPHISTOPHELES

But see! He's dead therefrom, at last.
Were I in _your_ place, do not doubt me,
I'd mourn him decently a year,
And for another keep, meanwhile, my eyes about me.


MARTHA

Ah, God! another one so dear
As was my first, this world will hardly give me.
There never was a sweeter fool than mine,
Only he loved to roam and leave me,
And foreign wenches and foreign wine,
And the damned throw of dice, indeed.


MEPHISTOPHELES

Well, well! That might have done, however,
If he had only been as clever,
And treated _your_ slips with as little heed.
I swear, with this condition, too,
I would, myself, change rings with you.


MARTHA

The gentleman is pleased to jest.


MEPHISTOPHELES

I'll cut away, betimes, from here:
She'd take the Devil at his word, I fear.

(_To_ MARGARET)

How fares the heart within your breast?


MARGARET

What means the gentleman?


MEPHISTOPHELES (_aside_)

  Sweet innocent, thou art!

(_Aloud_.)

 Ladies, farewell!


MARGARET

Farewell!


MARTHA

                  A moment, ere we part!
I'd like to have a legal witness,
Where, how, and when he died, to certify his fitness.
Irregular ways I've always hated;
I want his death in the weekly paper stated.


MEPHISTOPHELES

Yes, my good dame, a pair of witnesses
Always the truth establishes.
I have a friend of high condition,
Who'll also add his deposition.
I'll bring him here.


MARTHA

                  Good Sir, pray do!


MEPHISTOPHELES

And this young lady will be present, too?
A gallant youth! has travelled far:
Ladies with him delighted are.


MARGARET

Before him I should blush, ashamed.


MEPHISTOPHELES

Before no king that could be named!


MARTHA

Behind the house, in my garden, then,
This eve we'll expect the gentlemen.

[Illustration]




XI


A STREET

FAUST MEPHISTOPHELES

FAUST

How is it? under way? and soon complete?

MEPHISTOPHELES

Ah, bravo! Do I find you burning?
Well, Margaret soon will still your yearning:
At Neighbor Martha's you'll this evening meet.
A fitter woman ne'er was made
To ply the pimp and gypsy trade!

FAUST

Tis well.

MEPHISTOPHELES

Yet something is required from us.

FAUST

One service pays the other thus.

MEPHISTOPHELES

We've but to make a deposition valid
That now her husband's limbs, outstretched and pallid,
At Padua rest, in consecrated soil.

FAUST

Most wise! And first, of course, we'll make the journey
  thither?

MEPHISTOPHELES

_Sancta simplicitas_! no need of such a toil;
Depose, with knowledge or without it, either!

FAUST

If you've naught better, then, I'll tear your pretty plan!

MEPHISTOPHELES

Now, there you are! O holy man!
Is it the first time in your life you're driven
To bear false witness in a case?
Of God, the world and all that in it has a place,
Of Man, and all that moves the being of his race,
Have you not terms and definitions given
With brazen forehead, daring breast?
And, if you'll probe the thing profoundly,
Knew you so much--and you'll confess it roundly!--
As here of Schwerdtlein's death and place of rest?

FAUST

Thou art, and thou remain'st, a sophist, liar.

MEPHISTOPHELES

Yes, knew I not more deeply thy desire.
For wilt thou not, no lover fairer,
Poor Margaret flatter, and ensnare her,
And all thy soul's devotion swear her?

FAUST

And from my heart.

MEPHISTOPHELES

  'Tis very fine!
Thine endless love, thy faith assuring,
The one almighty force enduring,--
Will that, too, prompt this heart of thine?

FAUST

Hold! hold! It will!--If such my flame,
And for the sense and power intense
I seek, and cannot find, a name;
Then range with all my senses through creation,
Craving the speech of inspiration,
And call this ardor, so supernal,
Endless, eternal and eternal,--
Is that a devilish lying game?

MEPHISTOPHELES

And yet I'm right!

FAUST

  Mark this, I beg of thee!
And spare my lungs henceforth: whoever
Intends to have the right, if but his
  tongue be clever,
Will have it, certainly.
But come: the further talking brings
  disgust,
For thou art right, especially since I
  must.

GARDEN

(MARGARET _on_ FAUST'S _arm_. MARTHA _and_ MEPHISTOPHELES
_walking up and down_.)

MARGARET

I feel, the gentleman allows for me,
Demeans himself, and shames me by it;
A traveller is so used to be
Kindly content with any diet.
I know too well that my poor gossip can
Ne'er entertain such an experienced man.

FAUST

A look from thee, a word, more entertains
Than all the lore of wisest brains.

(_He kisses her hand_.)

MARGARET

Don't incommode yourself! How could you ever kiss it!
It is so ugly, rough to see!
What work I do,--how hard and steady is it!
Mother is much too close with me.

[_They pass_.

MARTHA

And you, Sir, travel always, do you not?

MEPHISTOPHELES

Alas, that trade and duty us so harry!
With what a pang one leaves so many a spot,
And dares not even now and then to tarry!

MARTHA

In young, wild years it suits your ways,
This round and round the world in freedom sweeping;
But then come on the evil days,
And so, as bachelor, into his grave a-creeping,
None ever found a thing to praise.

MEPHISTOPHELES

I dread to see how such a fate advances.

MARTHA

Then, worthy Sir, improve betimes your chances!

[_They pass_.

MARGARET

Yes, out of sight is out of mind!
Your courtesy an easy grace is;
But you have friends in other places,
And sensibler than I, you'll find.

FAUST

Trust me, dear heart! what men call sensible
Is oft mere vanity and narrowness.

MARGARET

  How so?

FAUST

Ah, that simplicity and innocence ne'er know
Themselves, their holy value, and their spell!
That meekness, lowliness, the highest graces
Which Nature portions out so lovingly--

MARGARET

So you but think a moment's space on me,
All times I'll have to think on you, all places!

FAUST

No doubt you're much alone?

MARGARET

Yes, for our household small has grown,
Yet must be cared for, you will own.
We have no maid: I do the knitting, sewing, sweeping,
The cooking, early work and late, in fact;
And mother, in her notions of housekeeping,
Is so exact!
Not that she needs so much to keep expenses down:
We, more than others, might take comfort, rather:
A nice estate was left us by my father,
A house, a little garden near the town.
But now my days have less of noise and hurry;
My brother is a soldier,
My little sister's dead.
True, with the child a troubled life I led,
Yet I would take again, and willing, all the worry,
So very dear was she.

FAUST

An angel, if like thee!

MARGARET

I brought it up, and it was fond of me.
Father had died before it saw the light,
And mother's case seemed hopeless quite,
So weak and miserable she lay;
And she recovered, then, so slowly, day by day.
She could not think, herself, of giving
The poor wee thing its natural living;
And so I nursed it all alone
With milk and water: 'twas my own.
Lulled in my lap with many a song,
It smiled, and tumbled, and grew strong.

FAUST

The purest bliss was surely then thy dower.

MARGARET

But surely, also, many a weary hour.
I kept the baby's cradle near
My bed at night: if 't even stirred, I'd guess it,
And waking, hear.
And I must nurse it, warm beside me press it,
And oft, to quiet it, my bed forsake,
And dandling back and forth the restless creature take,
Then at the wash-tub stand, at morning's break;
And then the marketing and kitchen-tending,
Day after day, the same thing, never-ending.
One's spirits, Sir, are thus not always good,
But then one learns to relish rest and food.

[_They pass_.

MARTHA

Yes, the poor women are bad off, 'tis true:
A stubborn bachelor there's no converting.

MEPHISTOPHELES

It but depends upon the like of you,
And I should turn to better ways than flirting.

MARTHA

Speak plainly, Sir, have you no one detected?
Has not your heart been anywhere subjected?

MEPHISTOPHELES

The proverb says: One's own warm hearth
And a good wife, are gold and jewels worth.

MARTHA

I mean, have you not felt desire, though ne'er so slightly?

MEPHISTOPHELES

I've everywhere, in fact, been entertained politely.

MARTHA

I meant to say, were you not touched in earnest, ever?

MEPHISTOPHELES

One should allow one's self to jest with ladies never.


MARTHA
Ah, you don't understand!

MEPHISTOPHELES

I'm sorry I'm so blind:
But I am sure--that you are very kind.

[_They pass_.

FAUST

And me, thou angel! didst thou recognize,
As through the garden-gate I came?

MARGARET

Did you not see it? I cast down my eyes.

FAUST

And thou forgiv'st my freedom, and the blame
To my impertinence befitting,
As the Cathedral thou wert quitting?

MARGARET

I was confused, the like ne'er happened me;
No one could ever speak to my discredit.
Ah, thought I, in my conduct has he read it--
Something immodest or unseemly free?
He seemed to have the sudden feeling
That with this wench 'twere very easy dealing.
I will confess, I knew not what appeal
On your behalf, here, in my bosom grew;
But I was angry with myself, to feel
That I could not be angrier with you.


FAUST

Sweet darling!

MARGARET

Wait a while!

(_She plucks a star-flower, and pulls off the leaves, one after
the other_.)

FAUST

Shall that a nosegay be?

MARGARET

No, it is just in play.

FAUST

How?

MARGARET

Go! you'll laugh at me.
(_She pulls off the leaves and murmurs_.)

FAUST

What murmurest thou?

MARGARET (_half aloud_)

He loves me--loves me not.

FAUST

Thou sweet, angelic soul!

MARGARET (_continues_)

Loves me--not--loves me--not--
(_plucking the last leaf, she cries with frank delight_:)

He loves me!

FAUST

Yes, child! and let this blossom-word
For thee be speech divine! He loves thee!
Ah, know'st thou what it means? He loves thee!

(_He grasps both her hands_.)

MARGARET

I'm all a-tremble!

FAUST

O tremble not! but let this look,
Let this warm clasp of hands declare thee
What is unspeakable!
To yield one wholly, and to feel a rapture
In yielding, that must be eternal!
Eternal!--for the end would be despair.
No, no,--no ending! no ending!

MARTHA (_coming forward_)

The night is falling.

MEPHISTOPHELES

                    Ay! we must away.

MARTHA

I'd ask you, longer here to tarry,
But evil tongues in this town have full play.
It's as if nobody had nothing to fetch and carry,
Nor other labor,
But spying all the doings of one's neighbor:
And one becomes the talk, do whatsoe'er one may.
Where is our couple now?

MEPHISTOPHELES

                 Flown up the alley yonder,
The wilful summer-birds!

MARTHA

                 He seems of her still fonder.

MEPHISTOPHELES

And she of him. So runs the world away!

A GARDEN-ARBOR

(MARGARET _comes in, conceals herself behind the door, puts her
finger to her lips, and peeps through the crack_.)

MARGARET

He comes!

FAUST (_entering_)

                  Ah, rogue! a tease thou art:
I have thee!
(_He kisses her_.)

MARGARET

(_clasping him, and returning the kiss_)
             Dearest man! I love thee from my heart.

(MEPHISTOPHELES _knocks_)

FAUST (_stamping his foot_)

Who's there?

MEPHISTOPHELES

A friend!

FAUST

              A beast!

MEPHISTOPHELES

             Tis time to separate.

MARTHA (_coming_)

Yes, Sir, 'tis late.

FAUST

            May I not, then, upon you wait?

MARGARET
My mother would--farewell!

FAUST

            Ah, can I not remain?
Farewell!

MARTHA

          Adieu!

MARGARET

             And soon to meet again!

[_Exeunt_ FAUST _and_ MEPHISTOPHELES.

MARGARET

Dear God! However is it, such
A man can think and know so much?
I stand ashamed and in amaze,
And answer "Yes" to all he says,
A poor, unknowing child! and he--
I can't think what he finds in me! [_Exit_.

FOREST AND CAVERN

FAUST (_solus_)

Spirit sublime, thou gav'st me, gav'st me all
For which I prayed. Not unto me in vain
Hast thou thy countenance revealed in fire.
Thou gav'st me Nature as a kingdom grand,
With power to feel and to enjoy it. Thou
Not only cold, amazed acquaintance yield'st,
But grantest, that in her profoundest breast
I gaze, as in the bosom of a friend.
The ranks of living creatures thou dost lead
Before me, teaching me to know my brothers
In air and water and the silent wood.
And when the storm in forests roars and grinds,
The giant firs, in falling, neighbor boughs
And neighbor trunks with crushing weight bear down,
And falling, fill the hills with hollow thunders,--
Then to the cave secure thou leadest me,
Then show'st me mine own self, and in my breast
The deep, mysterious miracles unfold.
And when the perfect moon before my gaze
Comes up with soothing light, around me float
From every precipice and thicket damp
The silvery phantoms of the ages past,
And temper the austere delight of thought.

That nothing can be perfect unto Man
I now am conscious. With this ecstasy,
Which brings me near and nearer to the Gods,
Thou gav'st the comrade, whom I now no more
Can do without, though, cold and scornful, he
Demeans me to myself, and with a breath,
A word, transforms thy gifts to nothingness.
Within my breast he fans a lawless fire,
Unwearied, for that fair and lovely form:
Thus in desire I hasten to enjoyment,
And in enjoyment pine to feel desire.

(MEPHISTOPHELES _enters_.)

MEPHISTOPHELES

Have you not led this life quite long enough?
How can a further test delight you?
'Tis very well, that once one tries the stuff,
But something new must then requite you.

FAUST

Would there were other work for thee!
To plague my day auspicious thou returnest.

MEPHISTOPHELES

Well! I'll engage to let thee be:
Thou darest not tell me so in earnest.
The loss of thee were truly very slight,--
comrade crazy, rude, repelling:

[Illustration]

One has one's hands full all the day and night;
If what one does, or leaves undone, is right,
From such a face as thine there is no telling.

FAUST

There is, again, thy proper tone!--
That thou hast bored me, I must thankful be!

MEPHISTOPHELES

Poor Son of Earth, how couldst thou thus alone
Have led thy life, bereft of me?
I, for a time, at least, have worked thy cure;
Thy fancy's rickets plague thee not at all:
Had I not been, so hadst thou, sure,
Walked thyself off this earthly ball
Why here to caverns, rocky hollows slinking,
Sit'st thou, as 'twere an owl a-blinking?
Why suck'st, from sodden moss and dripping stone,
Toad-like, thy nourishment alone?
A fine way, this, thy time to fill!
The Doctor's in thy body still.

FAUST

What fresh and vital forces, canst thou guess,
Spring from my commerce with the wilderness?
But, if thou hadst the power of guessing,
Thou wouldst be devil enough to grudge my soul the blessing.

MEPHISTOPHELES

A blessing drawn from supernatural fountains!
In night and dew to lie upon the mountains;
All Heaven and Earth in rapture penetrating;
Thyself to Godhood haughtily inflating;
To grub with yearning force through Earth's dark marrow,
Compress the six days' work within thy bosom narrow,--
To taste, I know not what, in haughty power,
Thine own ecstatic life on all things shower,
Thine earthly self behind thee cast,
And then the lofty instinct, thus--

(_With a gesture_:)

at last,--
daren't say how--to pluck the final flower!

FAUST

Shame on thee!

MEPHISTOPHELES

Yes, thou findest that unpleasant!
Thou hast the moral right to cry me "shame!" at present.
One dares not that before chaste ears declare,
Which chaste hearts, notwithstanding, cannot spare;
And, once for all, I grudge thee not the pleasure
Of lying to thyself in moderate measure.
But such a course thou wilt not long endure;
Already art thou o'er-excited,
And, if it last, wilt soon be plighted
To madness and to horror, sure.
Enough of that! Thy love sits lonely yonder,
By all things saddened and oppressed;
Her thoughts and yearnings seek thee, tenderer, fonder,--
mighty love is in her breast.
First came thy passion's flood and poured around her
As when from melted snow a streamlet overflows;
Thou hast therewith so filled and drowned her,
That now _thy_ stream all shallow shows.
Methinks, instead of in the forests lording,
The noble Sir should find it good,
The love of this young silly blood
At once to set about rewarding.
Her time is miserably long;
She haunts her window, watching clouds that stray
O'er the old city-wall, and far away.
"Were I a little bird!" so runs her song,
Day long, and half night long.
Now she is lively, mostly sad,
Now, wept beyond her tears;
Then again quiet she appears,--Always
love-mad.

FAUST

Serpent! Serpent!

MEPHISTOPHELES _(aside)_

Ha! do I trap thee!

FAUST

Get thee away with thine offences,
Reprobate! Name not that fairest thing,
Nor the desire for her sweet body bring
Again before my half-distracted senses!

MEPHISTOPHELES

What wouldst thou, then? She thinks that thou art flown;
And half and half thou art, I own.

FAUST

Yet am I near, and love keeps watch and ward;
Though I were ne'er so far, it cannot falter:
I envy even the Body of the Lord
The touching of her lips, before the altar.

MEPHISTOPHELES

'Tis very well! _My_ envy oft reposes
On your twin-pair, that feed among the roses.

FAUST

Away, thou pimp!

MEPHISTOPHELES

You rail, and it is fun to me.
The God, who fashioned youth and maid,
Perceived the noblest purpose of His trade,
And also made their opportunity.
Go on! It is a woe profound!
'Tis for your sweetheart's room you're bound,
And not for death, indeed.

FAUST

What are, within her arms, the heavenly blisses?
Though I be glowing with her kisses,
Do I not always share her need?
I am the fugitive, all houseless roaming,
The monster without air or rest,
That like a cataract, down rocks and gorges foaming,
Leaps, maddened, into the abyss's breast!
And side-wards she, with young unwakened senses,
Within her cabin on the Alpine field
Her simple, homely life commences,
Her little world therein concealed.
And I, God's hate flung o'er me,
Had not enough, to thrust
The stubborn rocks before me
And strike them into dust!
She and her peace I yet must undermine:
Thou, Hell, hast claimed this sacrifice as thine!
Help, Devil! through the coming pangs to push me;
What must be, let it quickly be!
Let fall on me her fate, and also crush me,--
One ruin whelm both her and me!

MEPHISTOPHELES

Again it seethes, again it glows!
Thou fool, go in and comfort her!
When such a head as thine no outlet knows,
It thinks the end must soon occur.
Hail him, who keeps a steadfast mind!
Thou, else, dost well the devil-nature wear:
Naught so insipid in the world I find
As is a devil in despair.

MARGARET'S ROOM

MARGARET

(_at the spinning-wheel, alone_)

        My peace is gone,
        My heart is sore:
        I never shall find it,
        Ah, nevermore!

        Save I have him near.
        The grave is here;
        The world is gall
        And bitterness all.

        My poor weak head
        Is racked and crazed;
        My thought is lost,
        My senses mazed.

        My peace is gone,
        My heart is sore:
        I never shall find it,
        Ah, nevermore!

        To see him, him only,
        At the pane I sit;
        To meet him, him only,
        The house I quit.

        His lofty gait,
        His noble size,
        The smile of his mouth,
        The power of his eyes,

        And the magic flow
        Of his talk, the bliss
        In the clasp of his hand,
        And, ah! his kiss!

        My peace is gone,
        My heart is sore:
        I never shall find it,
        Ah, nevermore!

        My bosom yearns
        For him alone;
        Ah, dared I clasp him,
        And hold, and own!

        And kiss his mouth,
        To heart's desire,
        And on his kisses
        At last expire!

MARTHA'S GARDEN

MARGARET FAUST

MARGARET

Promise me, Henry!--

FAUST

What I can!

MARGARET

How is't with thy religion, pray?
Thou art a dear, good-hearted man,
And yet, I think, dost not incline that way.

FAUST

Leave that, my child! Thou know'st my love is tender;
For love, my blood and life would I surrender,
And as for Faith and Church, I grant to each his own.

MARGARET

That's not enough: we must believe thereon.

FAUST

Must we?

MARGARET

Would that I had some influence!
Then, too, thou honorest not the Holy Sacraments.

FAUST

I honor them.

MARGARET

Desiring no possession
'Tis long since thou hast been to mass or to confession.
Believest thou in God?

FAUST

My darling, who shall dare
"I believe in God!" to say?
Ask priest or sage the answer to declare,
And it will seem a mocking play,
A sarcasm on the asker.

MARGARET

Then thou believest not!

FAUST

Hear me not falsely, sweetest countenance!
Who dare express Him?
And who profess Him,
Saying: I believe in Him!
Who, feeling, seeing,
Deny His being,
Saying: I believe Him not!
The All-enfolding,
The All-upholding,
Folds and upholds he not
Thee, me, Himself?
Arches not there the sky above us?
Lies not beneath us, firm, the earth?
And rise not, on us shining,
Friendly, the everlasting stars?
Look I not, eye to eye, on thee,
And feel'st not, thronging
To head and heart, the force,
Still weaving its eternal secret,
Invisible, visible, round thy life?
Vast as it is, fill with that force thy heart,
And when thou in the feeling wholly blessed art,
Call it, then, what thou wilt,--
Call it Bliss! Heart! Love! God!
I have no name to give it!
Feeling is all in all:
The Name is sound and smoke,
Obscuring Heaven's clear glow.

MARGARET

All that is fine and good, to hear it so:
Much the same way the preacher spoke,
Only with slightly different phrases.

FAUST

The same thing, in all places,
All hearts that beat beneath the heavenly day--
Each in its language--say;
Then why not I, in mine, as well?

MARGARET

To hear it thus, it may seem passable;
And yet, some hitch in't there must be
For thou hast no Christianity.

FAUST

Dear love!

MARGARET

                  I've long been grieved to see
That thou art in such company.

FAUST

How so?

MARGARET

        The man who with thee goes, thy mate,
Within my deepest, inmost soul I hate.
In all my life there's nothing
Has given my heart so keen a pang of loathing,
As his repulsive face has done.

FAUST

Nay, fear him not, my sweetest one!

MARGARET

I feel his presence like something ill.
I've else, for all, a kindly will,
But, much as my heart to see thee yearneth,
The secret horror of him returneth;
And I think the man a knave, as I live!
If I do him wrong, may God forgive!

FAUST

There must be such queer birds, however.

MARGARET

Live with the like of him, may I never!
When once inside the door comes he,
He looks around so sneeringly,
And half in wrath:
One sees that in nothing no interest he hath:
'Tis written on his very forehead
That love, to him, is a thing abhorréd.
I am so happy on thine arm,
So free, so yielding, and so warm,
And in his presence stifled seems my heart.

FAUST

Foreboding angel that thou art!

MARGARET

It overcomes me in such degree,
That wheresoe'er he meets us, even,
I feel as though I'd lost my love for thee.
When he is by, I could not pray to Heaven.
That burns within me like a flame,
And surely, Henry, 'tis with thee the same.

FAUST

There, now, is thine antipathy!

MARGARET

But I must go.

FAUST

                Ah, shall there never be
A quiet hour, to see us fondly plighted,
With breast to breast, and soul to soul united?

MARGARET

Ah, if I only slept alone!
I'd draw the bolts to-night, for thy desire;
But mother's sleep so light has grown,
And if we were discovered by her,
'Twould be my death upon the spot!

FAUST

Thou angel, fear it not!
Here is a phial: in her drink
But three drops of it measure,
And deepest sleep will on her senses sink.

MARGARET

What would I not, to give thee pleasure?
It will not harm her, when one tries it?

FAUST

If 'twould, my love, would I advise it?

MARGARET

Ah, dearest man, if but thy face I see,
I know not what compels me to thy will:
So much have I already done for thee,
That scarcely more is left me to fulfil.

(_Enter_ MEPHISTOPHELES.) [_Exit_.

MEPHISTOPHELES

The monkey! Is she gone?

FAUST

                          Hast played the spy again?

MEPHISTOPHELES

I've heard, most fully, how she drew thee.
The Doctor has been catechised, 'tis plain;
Great good, I hope, the thing will do thee.
The girls have much desire to ascertain
If one is prim and good, as ancient rules compel:
If there he's led, they think, he'll follow them as well.

FAUST

Thou, monster, wilt nor see nor own
How this pure soul, of faith so lowly,
So loving and ineffable,--
The faith alone
That her salvation is,--with scruples holy
Pines, lest she hold as lost the man she loves so well!

MEPHISTOPHELES

Thou, full of sensual, super-sensual desire,
A girl by the nose is leading thee.

FAUST

Abortion, thou, of filth and fire!

MEPHISTOPHELES

And then, how masterly she reads physiognomy!
When I am present she's impressed, she knows not how;
She in my mask a hidden sense would read:
She feels that surely I'm a genius now,--
Perhaps the very Devil, indeed!
Well, well,--to-night--?

FAUST

                          What's that to thee?

MEPHISTOPHELES

Yet my delight 'twill also be!

AT THE FOUNTAIN

MARGARET _and_ LISBETH _With pitchers_.

LISBETH

Hast nothing heard of Barbara?

MARGARET

No, not a word. I go so little out.

LISBETH

It's true, Sibylla said, to-day.
She's played the fool at last, there's not a doubt.
Such taking-on of airs!

MARGARET

                        How so?

LISBETH

                                 It stinks!
She's feeding two, whene'er she eats and drinks.

MARGARET

Ah!

LISBETH

    And so, at last, it serves her rightly.
She clung to the fellow so long and tightly!
That was a promenading!
At village and dance parading!
As the first they must everywhere shine,
And he treated her always to pies and wine,
And she made a to-do with her face so fine;
So mean and shameless was her behavior,
She took all the presents the fellow gave her.
'Twas kissing and coddling, on and on!
So now, at the end, the flower is gone.

MARGARET

The poor, poor thing!

LISBETH

                      Dost pity her, at that?
When one of us at spinning sat,
And mother, nights, ne'er let us out the door
She sported with her paramour.
On the door-bench, in the passage dark,
The length of the time they'd never mark.
So now her head no more she'll lift,
But do church-penance in her sinner's shift!

MARGARET

He'll surely take her for his wife.

LISBETH

He'd be a fool! A brisk young blade
Has room, elsewhere, to ply his trade.
Besides, he's gone.

MARGARET

                   That is not fair!

LISBETH

If him she gets, why let her beware!
The boys shall dash her wreath on the floor,
And we'll scatter chaff before her door!
                                              [_Exit_.

MARGARET (_returning home_)

How scornfully I once reviled,
When some poor maiden was beguiled!
More speech than any tongue suffices
I craved, to censure others' vices.
Black as it seemed, I blackened still,
And blacker yet was in my will;
And blessed myself, and boasted high,--
And now--a living sin am I!
Yet--all that drove my heart thereto,
God! was so good, so dear, so true!

DONJON

(_In a niche of the wall a shrine, with an image of the Mater
Dolorosa. Pots of flowers before it_.)

MARGARET

(_putting fresh flowers in the pots_)

        Incline, O Maiden,
        Thou sorrow-laden,
        Thy gracious countenance upon my pain!

        The sword Thy heart in,
        With anguish smarting,
        Thou lookest up to where Thy Son is slain!

        Thou seest the Father;
        Thy sad sighs gather,
        And bear aloft Thy sorrow and His pain!

        Ah, past guessing,
        Beyond expressing,
        The pangs that wring my flesh and bone!
        Why this anxious heart so burneth,
        Why it trembleth, why it yearneth,
        Knowest Thou, and Thou alone!

        Where'er I go, what sorrow,
        What woe, what woe and sorrow
        Within my bosom aches!
        Alone, and ah! unsleeping,
        I'm weeping, weeping, weeping,
        The heart within me breaks.

        The pots before my window,
        Alas! my tears did wet,
        As in the early morning
        For thee these flowers I set.

        Within my lonely chamber
        The morning sun shone red:
        I sat, in utter sorrow,
        Already on my bed.

        Help! rescue me from death and stain!
        O Maiden!
        Thou sorrow-laden,
        Incline Thy countenance upon my pain!

NIGHT

STREET BEFORE MARGARET'S DOOR

VALENTINE (_a soldier_, MARGARET'S _brother_)

When I have sat at some carouse.
Where each to each his brag allows,
And many a comrade praised to me
His pink of girls right lustily,
With brimming glass that spilled the toast,
And elbows planted as in boast:
I sat in unconcerned repose,
And heard the swagger as it rose.
And stroking then my beard, I'd say,
Smiling, the bumper in my hand:
"Each well enough in her own way.
But is there one in all the land
Like sister Margaret, good as gold,--
One that to her can a candle hold?"
Cling! clang! "Here's to her!" went around
The board: "He speaks the truth!" cried some;
"In her the flower o' the sex is found!"
And all the swaggerers were dumb.
And now!--I could tear my hair with vexation.
And dash out my brains in desperation!
With turned-up nose each scamp may face me,
With sneers and stinging taunts disgrace me,
And, like a bankrupt debtor sitting,
A chance-dropped word may set me sweating!
Yet, though I thresh them all together,
I cannot call them liars, either.

But what comes sneaking, there, to view?
If I mistake not, there are two.
If _he's_ one, let me at him drive!
He shall not leave the spot alive.

FAUST MEPHISTOPHELES

FAUST

How from the window of the sacristy
Upward th'eternal lamp sends forth a glimmer,
That, lessening side-wards, fainter grows and dimmer,
Till darkness closes from the sky!
The shadows thus within my bosom gather.

MEPHISTOPHELES

I'm like a sentimental tom-cat, rather,
That round the tall fire-ladders sweeps,
And stealthy, then, along the coping creeps:
Quite virtuous, withal, I come,
A little thievish and a little frolicsome.
I feel in every limb the presage
Forerunning the grand Walpurgis-Night:
Day after to-morrow brings its message,
And one keeps watch then with delight.

FAUST

Meanwhile, may not the treasure risen be,
Which there, behind, I glimmering see?

MEPHISTOPHELES

Shalt soon experience the pleasure,
To lift the kettle with its treasure.
I lately gave therein a squint--
Saw splendid lion-dollars in 't.

FAUST

Not even a jewel, not a ring,
To deck therewith my darling girl?

MEPHISTOPHELES

I saw, among the rest, a thing
That seemed to be a chain of pearl.

FAUST

That's well, indeed! For painful is it
To bring no gift when her I visit.

MEPHISTOPHELES

Thou shouldst not find it so annoying,
Without return to be enjoying.
Now, while the sky leads forth its starry throng,
Thou'lt hear a masterpiece, no work completer:
I'll sing her, first, a moral song,
The surer, afterwards, to cheat her.

(_Sings to the cither_.)

        What dost thou here
        In daybreak clear,
        Kathrina dear,
        Before thy lover's door?
        Beware! the blade
        Lets in a maid.
        That out a maid
        Departeth nevermore!

        The coaxing shun
        Of such an one!
        When once 'tis done
        Good-night to thee, poor thing!
        Love's time is brief:
        Unto no thief
        Be warm and lief,
        But with the wedding-ring!

VALENTINE (_comes forward_)

Whom wilt thou lure? God's-element!
Rat-catching piper, thou!--perdition!
To the Devil, first, the instrument!
To the Devil, then, the curst musician!

MEPHISTOPHELES

The cither's smashed! For nothing more 'tis fitting.

VALENTINE

There's yet a skull I must be splitting!

MEPHISTOPHELES (_to_ FAUST)

Sir Doctor, don't retreat, I pray!
Stand by: I'll lead, if you'll but tarry:
Out with your spit, without delay!
You've but to lunge, and I will parry.

VALENTINE

Then parry that!

MEPHISTOPHELES

                 Why not? 'tis light.
VALENTINE

That, too!

MEPHISTOPHELES

Of course.

VALENTINE

I think the Devil must fight!
How is it, then? my hand's already lame:

MEPHISTOPHELES (_to_ FAUST)

Thrust home!

VALENTINE (_jails_)

O God!

MEPHISTOPHELES

Now is the lubber tame!
But come, away! 'Tis time for us to fly;
For there arises now a murderous cry.
With the police 'twere easy to compound it,
But here the penal court will sift and sound it.

[_Exit with_ FAUST.

MARTHA (_at the window_)

Come out! Come out!

MARGARET (_at the window_)

Quick, bring a light!

MARTHA (_as above_)

They swear and storm, they yell and fight!

PEOPLE

Here lies one dead already--see!

MARTHA (_coming from the house_)

The murderers, whither have they run?

MARGARET (_coming out_)

Who lies here?

PEOPLE

'Tis thy mother's son!

MARGARET

Almighty God! what misery!

VALENTINE

I'm dying! That is quickly said,
And quicker yet 'tis done.
Why howl, you women there? Instead,
Come here and listen, every one!

(_All gather around him_)

My Margaret, see! still young thou art,
But not the least bit shrewd or smart,
Thy business thus to slight:
So this advice I bid thee heed--
Now that thou art a whore indeed,
Why, be one then, outright!

MARGARET

My brother! God! such words to me?

VALENTINE

In this game let our Lord God be!
What's done's already done, alas!
What follows it, must come to pass.
With one begin'st thou secretly,
Then soon will others come to thee,
And when a dozen thee have known,
Thou'rt also free to all the town.
When Shame is born and first appears,
She is in secret brought to light,
And then they draw the veil of night
Over her head and ears;
Her life, in fact, they're loath to spare her.
But let her growth and strength display,
She walks abroad unveiled by day,
Yet is not grown a whit the fairer.
The uglier she is to sight,
The more she seeks the day's broad light.
The time I verily can discern
When all the honest folk will turn
From thee, thou jade! and seek protection
As from a corpse that breeds infection.
Thy guilty heart shall then dismay thee.
When they but look thee in the face:--
Shalt not in a golden chain array thee,
Nor at the altar take thy place!
Shalt not, in lace and ribbons flowing,
Make merry when the dance is going!
But in some corner, woe betide thee!
Among the beggars and cripples hide thee;
And so, though even God forgive,
On earth a damned existence live!

MARTHA

Commend your soul to God for pardon,
That you your heart with slander harden!

VALENTINE

Thou pimp most infamous, be still!
Could I thy withered body kill,
'Twould bring, for all my sinful pleasure,
Forgiveness in the richest measure.

MARGARET

My brother! This is Hell's own pain!

VALENTINE

I tell thee, from thy tears refrain!
When thou from honor didst depart
It stabbed me to the very heart.
Now through the slumber of the grave
I go to God as a soldier brave.

CATHEDRAL

SERVICE, ORGAN _and_ ANTHEM.

(MARGARET _among much people: the_ EVIL SPIRIT _behind_
MARGARET.)

EVIL SPIRIT

HOW otherwise was it, Margaret,
When thou, still innocent,
Here to the altar cam'st,
And from the worn and fingered book
Thy prayers didst prattle,
Half sport of childhood,
Half God within thee!
Margaret!
Where tends thy thought?
Within thy bosom
What hidden crime?
Pray'st thou for mercy on thy mother's soul,
That fell asleep to long, long torment, and through thee?
Upon thy threshold whose the blood?
And stirreth not and quickens
Something beneath thy heart,
Thy life disquieting
With most foreboding presence?

MARGARET

Woe! woe!
Would I were free from the thoughts
That cross me, drawing hither and thither
Despite me!

CHORUS

        _Diesira, dies illa,
        Solvet soeclum in favilla_!
        _(Sound of the organ_.)

EVIL SPIRIT

Wrath takes thee!
The trumpet peals!
The graves tremble!
And thy heart
From ashy rest
To fiery torments
Now again requickened,
Throbs to life!

MARGARET

Would I were forth!
I feel as if the organ here
My breath takes from me,
My very heart
Dissolved by the anthem!


CHORUS

        _Judex ergo cum sedebit,
        Quidquid latet, ad parebit,
        Nil inultum remanebit_.
MARGARET

I cannot breathe!
The massy pillars
Imprison me!
The vaulted arches
Crush me!--Air!

EVIL SPIRIT

Hide thyself! Sin and shame
Stay never hidden.
Air? Light?
Woe to thee!

CHORUS

        _Quid sum miser tunc dicturus,
        Quem patronem rogaturus,
        Cum vix Justus sit securus_?

EVIL SPIRIT

They turn their faces,
The glorified, from thee:
The pure, their hands to offer,
Shuddering, refuse thee!
Woe!

CHORUS

_Quid sum miser tune dicturus_?

MARGARET

Neighbor! your cordial! (_She falls in a swoon_.)

WALPURGIS-NIGHT

THE HARTZ MOUNTAINS.

_District of Schierke and Elend_.

FAUST MEPHISTOPHELES

MEPHISTOPHELES

DOST thou not wish a broomstick-steed's assistance?
The sturdiest he-goat I would gladly see:
The way we take, our goal is yet some distance.

FAUST

So long as in my legs I feel the fresh existence.
This knotted staff suffices me.
What need to shorten so the way?
Along this labyrinth of vales to wander,
Then climb the rocky ramparts yonder,
Wherefrom the fountain flings eternal spray,
Is such delight, my steps would fain delay.
The spring-time stirs within the fragrant birches,
And even the fir-tree feels it now:
Should then our limbs escape its gentle searches?

MEPHISTOPHELES

I notice no such thing, I vow!
'Tis winter still within my body:
Upon my path I wish for frost and snow.
How sadly rises, incomplete and ruddy,
The moon's lone disk, with its belated glow,
And lights so dimly, that, as one advances,
At every step one strikes a rock or tree!
Let us, then, use a Jack-o'-lantern's glances:
I see one yonder, burning merrily.
Ho, there! my friend! I'll levy thine attendance:
Why waste so vainly thy resplendence?
Be kind enough to light us up the steep!

WILL-O'-THE-WISP

My reverence, I hope, will me enable
To curb my temperament unstable;
For zigzag courses we are wont to keep.

MEPHISTOPHELES

Indeed? he'd like mankind to imitate!
Now, in the Devil's name, go straight,
Or I'll blow out his being's flickering spark!

WILL-O'-THE-WISP

You are the master of the house, I mark,
And I shall try to serve you nicely.
But then, reflect: the mountain's magic-mad to-day,
And if a will-o'-the-wisp must guide you on the way,
You mustn't take things too precisely.

FAUST, MEPHISTOPHELES, WILL-O'-THE-WISP

(_in alternating song_)

     We, it seems, have entered newly
     In the sphere of dreams enchanted.
     Do thy bidding, guide us truly,
     That our feet be forwards planted
     In the vast, the desert spaces!
     See them swiftly changing places,
     Trees on trees beside us trooping,
     And the crags above us stooping,
     And the rocky snouts, outgrowing,--
     Hear them snoring, hear them blowing!
     O'er the stones, the grasses, flowing
     Stream and streamlet seek the hollow.
     Hear I noises? songs that follow?
     Hear I tender love-petitions?
     Voices of those heavenly visions?
     Sounds of hope, of love undying!
     And the echoes, like traditions
     Of old days, come faint and hollow.

     Hoo-hoo! Shoo-hoo! Nearer hover
     Jay and screech-owl, and the plover,--
     Are they all awake and crying?
     Is't the salamander pushes,
     Bloated-bellied, through the bushes?
     And the roots, like serpents twisted,
     Through the sand and boulders toiling,
     Fright us, weirdest links uncoiling
     To entrap us, unresisted:
     Living knots and gnarls uncanny
     Feel with polypus-antennae
     For the wanderer. Mice are flying,
     Thousand-colored, herd-wise hieing
     Through the moss and through the heather!

     And the fire-flies wink and darkle,
     Crowded swarms that soar and sparkle,
     And in wildering escort gather!

     Tell me, if we still are standing,
     Or if further we're ascending?
     All is turning, whirling, blending,
     Trees and rocks with grinning faces,
     Wandering lights that spin in mazes,
     Still increasing and expanding!

MEPHISTOPHELES

Grasp my skirt with heart undaunted!
Here a middle-peak is planted,
Whence one seeth, with amaze,
Mammon in the mountain blaze.

FAUST

How strangely glimmers through the hollows
A dreary light, like that of dawn!
Its exhalation tracks and follows
The deepest gorges, faint and wan.
Here steam, there rolling vapor sweepeth;
Here burns the glow through film and haze:
Now like a tender thread it creepeth,
Now like a fountain leaps and plays.
Here winds away, and in a hundred
Divided veins the valley braids:
There, in a corner pressed and sundered,
Itself detaches, spreads and fades.
Here gush the sparkles incandescent
Like scattered showers of golden sand;--
But, see! in all their height, at present,
The rocky ramparts blazing stand.

[Illustration: _Under the old ribs of the rock retreating_,]

MEPHISTOPHELES

Has not Sir Mammon grandly lighted
His palace for this festal night?
'Tis lucky thou hast seen the sight;
The boisterous guests approach that were invited.

FAUST

How raves the tempest through the air!
With what fierce blows upon my neck 'tis beating!

MEPHISTOPHELES

Under the old ribs of the rock retreating,
Hold fast, lest thou be hurled down the abysses there!
The night with the mist is black;
Hark! how the forests grind and crack!
Frightened, the owlets are scattered:
Hearken! the pillars are shattered.
The evergreen palaces shaking!
Boughs are groaning and breaking,
The tree-trunks terribly thunder,
The roots are twisting asunder!
In frightfully intricate crashing
Each on the other is dashing,
And over the wreck-strewn gorges
The tempest whistles and surges!
Hear'st thou voices higher ringing?
Far away, or nearer singing?
Yes, the mountain's side along,
Sweeps an infuriate glamouring song!

WITCHES (_in chorus_)

     The witches ride to the Brocken's top,
     The stubble is yellow, and green the crop.
     There gathers the crowd for carnival:
     Sir Urian sits over all.

     And so they go over stone and stock;
     The witch she-----s, and-----s the buck.

A VOICE

     Alone, old Baubo's coming now;
     She rides upon a farrow-sow.

CHORUS

     Then honor to whom the honor is due!
     Dame Baubo first, to lead the crew!
     A tough old sow and the mother thereon,
     Then follow the witches, every one.

A VOICE

Which way com'st thou hither?

VOICE

O'er the Ilsen-stone.
I peeped at the owl in her nest alone:
How she stared and glared!

VOICE

Betake thee to Hell!
Why so fast and so fell?

VOICE

She has scored and has flayed me:
See the wounds she has made me!

WITCHES (_chorus_)

     The way is wide, the way is long:
     See, what a wild and crazy throng!
     The broom it scratches, the fork it thrusts,
     The child is stifled, the mother bursts.
WIZARDS (_semichorus_)

     As doth the snail in shell, we crawl:
     Before us go the women all.
     When towards the Devil's House we tread,
     Woman's a thousand steps ahead.

OTHER SEMICHORUS

     We do not measure with such care:
     Woman in thousand steps is theft.
     But howsoe'er she hasten may,
     Man in one leap has cleared the way.

VOICE (_from above_)

Come on, come on, from Rocky Lake!

VOICE (_from below_)

Aloft we'd fain ourselves betake.
We've washed, and are bright as ever you will,
Yet we're eternally sterile still.

BOTH CHORUSES

     The wind is hushed, the star shoots by.
     The dreary moon forsakes the sky;
     The magic notes, like spark on spark,
     Drizzle, whistling through the dark.

VOICE (_from below_)

Halt, there! Ho, there!

VOICE (_from above_)

Who calls from the rocky cleft below there?

VOICE (_below_)

Take me, too! take me, too!
I'm climbing now three hundred years,
And yet the summit cannot see:
Among my equals I would be.

BOTH CHORUSES

     Bears the broom and bears the stock,
     Bears the fork and bears the buck:
     Who cannot raise himself to-night
     Is evermore a ruined wight.

HALF-WITCH (_below_)

So long I stumble, ill bestead,
And the others are now so far ahead!
At home I've neither rest nor cheer,
And yet I cannot gain them here.

CHORUS OF WITCHES

     To cheer the witch will salve avail;
     A rag will answer for a sail;
     Each trough a goodly ship supplies;
     He ne'er will fly, who now not flies.

BOTH CHORUSES

     When round the summit whirls our flight,
     Then lower, and on the ground alight;
     And far and wide the heather press
     With witchhood's swarms of wantonness!

(_They settle down_.)

MEPHISTOPHELES

They crowd and push, they roar and clatter!
They whirl and whistle, pull and chatter!
They shine, and spirt, and stink, and burn!
The true witch-element we learn.
Keep close! or we are parted, in our turn,
Where art thou?

FAUST (_in the distance_)

Here!

MEPHISTOPHELES

What! whirled so far astray?
Then house-right I must use, and clear the way.
Make room! Squire Voland comes! Room, gentle rabble,
room!

Here, Doctor, hold to me: in one jump we'll resume
An easier space, and from the crowd be free:
It's too much, even for the like of me.
Yonder, with special light, there's something shining clearer
Within those bushes; I've a mind to see.
Come on! we'll slip a little nearer.

FAUST

Spirit of Contradiction! On! I'll follow straight.
'Tis planned most wisely, if I judge aright:
We climb the Brocken's top in the Walpurgis-Night,
That arbitrarily, here, ourselves we isolate.

MEPHISTOPHELES

But see, what motley flames among the heather!
There is a lively club together:
In smaller circles one is not alone.

FAUST

Better the summit, I must own:
There fire and whirling smoke I see.
They seek the Evil One in wild confusion:
Many enigmas there might find solution.

MEPHISTOPHELES

But there enigmas also knotted be.
Leave to the multitude their riot!
Here will we house ourselves in quiet.
It is an old, transmitted trade,
That in the greater world the little worlds are made.
I see stark-nude young witches congregate,
And old ones, veiled and hidden shrewdly:
On my account be kind, nor treat them rudely!
The trouble's small, the fun is great.
I hear the noise of instruments attuning,--
Vile din! yet one must learn to bear the crooning.
Come, come along! It _must_ be, I declare!
I'll go ahead and introduce thee there,
Thine obligation newly earning.
That is no little space: what say'st thou, friend?
Look yonder! thou canst scarcely see the end:
A hundred fires along the ranks are burning.
They dance, they chat, they cook, they drink, they court:
Now where, just tell me, is there better sport?

FAUST

Wilt thou, to introduce us to the revel,
Assume the part of wizard or of devil?

MEPHISTOPHELES

I'm mostly used, 'tis true, to go incognito,
But on a gala-day one may his orders show.
The Garter does not deck my suit,
But honored and at home is here the cloven foot.
Perceiv'st thou yonder snail? It cometh, slow and steady;
So delicately its feelers pry,
That it hath scented me already:
I cannot here disguise me, if I try.
But come! we'll go from this fire to a newer:
I am the go-between, and thou the wooer.

(_To some, who are sitting around dying embers_:)

Old gentlemen, why at the outskirts? Enter!
I'd praise you if I found you snugly in the centre,
With youth and revel round you like a zone:
You each, at home, are quite enough alone.

GENERAL

Say, who would put his trust in nations,
Howe'er for them one may have worked and planned?
For with the people, as with women,
Youth always has the upper hand.

MINISTER

They're now too far from what is just and sage.
I praise the old ones, not unduly:
When we were all-in-all, then, truly,
_Then_ was the real golden age.

PARVENU

We also were not stupid, either,
And what we should not, often did;
But now all things have from their bases slid,
Just as we meant to hold them fast together.

AUTHOR

Who, now, a work of moderate sense will read?
Such works are held as antiquate and mossy;
And as regards the younger folk, indeed,
They never yet have been so pert and saucy.

MEPHISTOPHELES

(_who all at once appears very old_)

I feel that men are ripe for Judgment-Day,
Now for the last time I've the witches'-hill ascended:
Since to the lees _my_ cask is drained away,
The world's, as well, must soon be ended.

HUCKSTER-WITCH

Ye gentlemen, don't pass me thus!
Let not the chance neglected be!
Behold my wares attentively:
The stock is rare and various.
And yet, there's nothing I've collected--
No shop, on earth, like this you'll find!--
Which has not, once, sore hurt inflicted
Upon the world, and on mankind.
No dagger's here, that set not blood to flowing;
No cup, that hath not once, within a healthy frame
Poured speedy death, in poison glowing:
No gems, that have not brought a maid to shame;
No sword, but severed ties for the unwary,
Or from behind struck down the adversary.

MEPHISTOPHELES

Gossip! the times thou badly comprehendest:
What's done has happed--what haps, is done!
'Twere better if for novelties thou sendest:
By such alone can we be won.

FAUST

Let me not lose myself in all this pother!
This is a fair, as never was another!

MEPHISTOPHELES

The whirlpool swirls to get above:
Thou'rt shoved thyself, imagining to shove.

FAUST

But who is that?

MEPHISTOPHELES

Note her especially,
Tis Lilith.

FAUST

Who?

MEPHISTOPHELES

Adam's first wife is she.
Beware the lure within her lovely tresses,
The splendid sole adornment of her hair!
When she succeeds therewith a youth to snare,
Not soon again she frees him from her jesses.

FAUST

Those two, the old one with the young one sitting,
They've danced already more than fitting.

MEPHISTOPHELES

No rest to-night for young or old!
They start another dance: come now, let us take hold!

FAUST (_dancing with the young witch_)

     A lovely dream once came to me;
     I then beheld an apple-tree,
     And there two fairest apples shone:
     They lured me so, I climbed thereon.

THE FAIR ONE

     Apples have been desired by you,
     Since first in Paradise they grew;
     And I am moved with joy, to know
     That such within my garden grow.

MEPHISTOPHELES (_dancing with the old one_)

     A dissolute dream once came to me:
     Therein I saw a cloven tree,
     Which had a-----------------;
     Yet,-----as 'twas, I fancied it.

THE OLD ONE

     I offer here my best salute
     Unto the knight with cloven foot!
     Let him a-----------prepare,
     If him------------------does not scare.

PROKTOPHANTASMIST

Accurséd folk! How dare you venture thus?
Had you not, long since, demonstration
That ghosts can't stand on ordinary foundation?
And now you even dance, like one of us!

THE FAIR ONE (_dancing_)

Why does he come, then, to our ball?

FAUST (_dancing_)

O, everywhere on him you fall!
When others dance, he weighs the matter:
If he can't every step bechatter,
Then 'tis the same as were the step not made;
But if you forwards go, his ire is most displayed.
If you would whirl in regular gyration
As he does in his dull old mill,
He'd show, at any rate, good-will,--
Especially if you heard and heeded his hortation.

PROKTOPHANTASMIST

You still are here? Nay, 'tis a thing unheard!
Vanish, at once! We've said the enlightening word.
The pack of devils by no rules is daunted:
We are so wise, and yet is Tegel haunted.
To clear the folly out, how have I swept and stirred!
Twill ne'er be clean: why, 'tis a thing unheard!

THE FAIR ONE

Then cease to bore us at our ball!

PROKTOPHANTASMIST

I tell you, spirits, to your face,
I give to spirit-despotism no place;
My spirit cannot practise it at all.

(_The dance continues_)

Naught will succeed, I see, amid such revels;
Yet something from a tour I always save,
And hope, before my last step to the grave,
To overcome the poets and the devils.

MEPHISTOPHELES

He now will seat him in the nearest puddle;
The solace this, whereof he's most assured:
And when upon his rump the leeches hang and fuddle,
He'll be of spirits and of Spirit cured.

(_To_ FAUST, _who has left the dance_:)

Wherefore forsakest thou the lovely maiden,
That in the dance so sweetly sang?

FAUST

Ah! in the midst of it there sprang
A red mouse from her mouth--sufficient reason.

MEPHISTOPHELES

That's nothing! One must not so squeamish be;
So the mouse was not gray, enough for thee.
Who'd think of that in love's selected season?

FAUST

Then saw I--.

MEPHISTOPHELES

What?

FAUST

Mephisto, seest thou there,
Alone and far, a girl most pale and fair?
She falters on, her way scarce knowing,
As if with fettered feet that stay her going.
I must confess, it seems to me
As if my kindly Margaret were she.

MEPHISTOPHELES

Let the thing be! All thence have evil drawn:
It is a magic shape, a lifeless eidolon.
Such to encounter is not good:
Their blank, set stare benumbs the human blood,
And one is almost turned to stone.
Medusa's tale to thee is known.

FAUST

Forsooth, the eyes they are of one whom, dying,
No hand with loving pressure closed;
That is the breast whereon I once was lying,--
The body sweet, beside which I reposed!

MEPHISTOPHELES

Tis magic all, thou fool, seduced so easily!
Unto each man his love she seems to be.

FAUST

The woe, the rapture, so ensnare me,
That from her gaze I cannot tear me!
And, strange! around her fairest throat
A single scarlet band is gleaming,
No broader than a knife-blade seeming!

MEPHISTOPHELES

Quite right! The mark I also note.
Her head beneath her arm she'll sometimes carry;
Twas Perseus lopped it, her old adversary.
Thou crav'st the same illusion still!
Come, let us mount this little hill;
The Prater shows no livelier stir,
And, if they've not bewitched my sense,
I verily see a theatre.
What's going on?

SERVIBILIS
                 'Twill shortly recommence:
A new performance--'tis the last of seven.
To give that number is the custom here:
'Twas by a Dilettante written,
And Dilettanti in the parts appear.
That now I vanish, pardon, I entreat you!
As Dilettante I the curtain raise.

MEPHISTOPHELES
When I upon the Blocksberg meet you,
I find it good: for that's your proper place.

WALPURGIS-NIGHT'S DREAM

OBERON AND TITANIA's GOLDEN WEDDING

INTERMEZZO

MANAGER

Sons of Mieding, rest to-day!
Needless your machinery:
Misty vale and mountain gray,
That is all the scenery.

HERALD

That the wedding golden be.
Must fifty years be rounded:
But _the Golden_ give to me,
When the strife's compounded.

OBERON

Spirits, if you're here, be seen--
Show yourselves, delighted!
Fairy king and fairy queen,
They are newly plighted.

PUCK

Cometh Puck, and, light of limb,
Whisks and whirls in measure:
Come a hundred after him,
To share with him the pleasure.

ARIEL

Ariel's song is heavenly-pure,
His tones are sweet and rare ones:
Though ugly faces he allure,
Yet he allures the fair ones.

OBERON

Spouses, who would fain agree,
Learn how we were mated!
If your pairs would loving be,
First be separated!

TITANIA

If her whims the wife control,
And the man berate her,
Take him to the Northern Pole,
And her to the Equator!

ORCHESTRA. TUTTI.

_Fortissimo_.

Snout of fly, mosquito-bill,
And kin of all conditions,
Frog in grass, and cricket-trill,--
These are the musicians!

SOLO

See the bagpipe on our track!
'Tis the soap-blown bubble:
Hear the _schnecke-schnicke-schnack_
Through his nostrils double!

SPIRIT, JUST GROWING INTO FORM

Spider's foot and paunch of toad,
And little wings--we know 'em!
A little creature 'twill not be,
But yet, a little poem.

A LITTLE COUPLE

Little step and lofty leap
Through honey-dew and fragrance:
You'll never mount the airy steep
With all your tripping vagrance.

INQUISITIVE TRAVELLER

Is't but masquerading play?
See I with precision?
Oberon, the beauteous fay,
Meets, to-night, my vision!

ORTHODOX

Not a claw, no tail I see!
And yet, beyond a cavil,
Like "the Gods of Greece," must he
Also be a devil.

NORTHERN ARTIST

I only seize, with sketchy air,
Some outlines of the tourney;
Yet I betimes myself prepare
For my Italian journey.

PURIST

My bad luck brings me here, alas!
How roars the orgy louder!
And of the witches in the mass,
But only two wear powder.

YOUNG WITCH

Powder becomes, like petticoat,
A gray and wrinkled noddy;
So I sit naked on my goat,
And show a strapping body.

MATRON

We've too much tact and policy
To rate with gibes a scolder;
Yet, young and tender though you be,
I hope to see you moulder.

LEADER OF THE BAND

Fly-snout and mosquito-bill,
Don't swarm so round the Naked!
Frog in grass and cricket-trill,
Observe the time, and make it!

WEATHERCOCK (_towards one side_)

Society to one's desire!
Brides only, and the sweetest!
And bachelors of youth and fire.
And prospects the completest!

WEATHERCOCK (_towards the other side_)

And if the Earth don't open now
To swallow up each ranter,
Why, then will I myself, I vow,
Jump into hell instanter!

XENIES

Us as little insects see!
With sharpest nippers flitting,
That our Papa Satan we
May honor as is fitting.

HENNINGS

How, in crowds together massed,
They are jesting, shameless!
They will even say, at last,
That their hearts are blameless.

MUSAGETES

Among this witches' revelry
His way one gladly loses;
And, truly, it would easier be
Than to command the Muses.

CI-DEVANT GENIUS OF THE AGE

The proper folks one's talents laud:
Come on, and none shall pass us!
The Blocksberg has a summit broad,
Like Germany's Parnassus.

INQUISITIVE TRAVELLER

Say, who's the stiff and pompous man?
He walks with haughty paces:
He snuffles all he snuffle can:
"He scents the Jesuits' traces."

CRANE

Both clear and muddy streams, for me
Are good to fish and sport in:
And thus the pious man you see
With even devils consorting.

WORLDLING

Yes, for the pious, I suspect,
All instruments are fitting;
And on the Blocksberg they erect
Full many a place of meeting.

DANCER

A newer chorus now succeeds!
I hear the distant drumming.
"Don't be disturbed! 'tis, in the reeds,
The bittern's changeless booming."

DANCING-MASTER

How each his legs in nimble trip
Lifts up, and makes a clearance!
The crooked jump, the heavy skip,
Nor care for the appearance.

GOOD FELLOW

The rabble by such hate are held,
To maim and slay delights them:
As Orpheus' lyre the brutes compelled,
The bagpipe here unites them.

DOGMATIST

I'll not be led by any lure
Of doubts or critic-cavils:
The Devil must be something, sure,--
Or how should there be devils?

IDEALIST

This once, the fancy wrought in me
Is really too despotic:
Forsooth, if I am all I see,
I must be idiotic!

REALIST

This racking fuss on every hand,
It gives me great vexation;
And, for the first time, here I stand
On insecure foundation.

SUPERNATURALIST

With much delight I see the play,
And grant to these their merits,
Since from the devils I also may
Infer the better spirits.

SCEPTIC

The flame they follow, on and on,
And think they're near the treasure:
But _Devil_ rhymes with _Doubt_ alone,
So I am here with pleasure.

LEADER OF THE BAND

Frog in green, and cricket-trill.
Such dilettants!--perdition!
Fly-snout and mosquito-bill,--
Each one's a fine musician!

THE ADROIT

_Sans souci_, we call the clan
Of merry creatures so, then;
Go a-foot no more we can,
And on our heads we go, then.

THE AWKWARD

Once many a bit we sponged, but now,
God help us! that is done with:
Our shoes are all danced out, we trow,
We've but naked soles to run with.

WILL-O'-THE WISPS

From the marshes we appear,
Where we originated;
Yet in the ranks, at once, we're here
As glittering gallants rated.

SHOOTING-STAR

Darting hither from the sky,
In star and fire light shooting,
Cross-wise now in grass I lie:
Who'll help me to my footing?

THE HEAVY FELLOWS

Room! and round about us, room!
Trodden are the grasses:
Spirits also, spirits come,
And they are bulky masses.

PUCK

Enter not so stall-fed quite,
Like elephant-calves about one!
And the heaviest weight to-night
Be Puck, himself, the stout one!

ARIEL

If loving Nature at your back,
Or Mind, the wings uncloses,
Follow up my airy track
To the mount of roses!

ORCHESTRA

_pianissimo_
Cloud and trailing mist o'erhead
Are now illuminated:
Air in leaves, and wind in reed,
And all is dissipated.

DREARY DAY

A FIELD

FAUST MEPHISTOPHELES

FAUST

In misery! In despair! Long wretchedly astray on the face of the earth,
and now imprisoned! That gracious, ill-starred creature shut in a
dungeon as a criminal, and given up to fearful torments! To this has it
come! to this!--Treacherous, contemptible spirit, and thou hast
concealed it from me!--Stand, then,--stand! Roll the devilish eyes
wrathfully in thy head! Stand and defy me with thine intolerable
presence! Imprisoned! In irretrievable misery! Delivered up to evil
spirits, and to condemning, unfeeling Man! And thou hast lulled me,
meanwhile, with the most insipid dissipations, hast concealed from me
her increasing wretchedness, and suffered her to go helplessly to ruin!
[Illustration: _Roll the devilish eyes wrathfully in thy head_]


MEPHISTOPHELES

She is not the first.

FAUST

Dog! Abominable monster! Transform him, thou Infinite Spirit! transform
the reptile again into his dog-shape? in which it pleased him often at
night to scamper on before me, to roll himself at the feet of the
unsuspecting wanderer, and hang upon his shoulders when he fell!
Transform him again into his favorite likeness, that he may crawl upon
his belly in the dust before me,--that I may trample him, the outlawed,
under foot! Not the first! O woe! woe which no human soul can grasp,
that more than one being should sink into the depths of this
misery,--that the first, in its writhing death-agony under the eyes of
the Eternal Forgiver, did not expiate the guilt of all others! The
misery of this single one pierces to the very marrow of my life; and
thou art calmly grinning at the fate of thousands!

MEPHISTOPHELES

Now we are already again at the end of our wits, where the understanding
of you men runs wild. Why didst thou enter into fellowship with us, if
thou canst not carry it out? Wilt fly, and art not secure against
dizziness? Did we thrust ourselves upon thee, or thou thyself upon us?

FAUST

Gnash not thus thy devouring teeth at me? It fills me with horrible
disgust. Mighty, glorious Spirit, who hast vouchsafed to me Thine
apparition, who knowest my heart and my soul, why fetter me to the
felon-comrade, who feeds on mischief and gluts himself with ruin?

MEPHISTOPHELES

Hast thou done?

FAUST

Rescue her, or woe to thee! The fearfullest curse be upon thee for
thousands of ages!

MEPHISTOPHELES

I cannot loosen the bonds of the Avenger, nor undo his bolts. Rescue
her? Who was it that plunged her into ruin? I, or thou?

(FAUST _looks around wildly_.)

Wilt thou grasp the thunder? Well that it has not been given to you,
miserable mortals! To crush to pieces the innocent respondent--that is
the tyrant-fashion of relieving one's self in embarrassments.

FAUST

Take me thither! She shall be free!

MEPHISTOPHELES

And the danger to which thou wilt expose thyself? Know that the guilt of
blood, from thy hand, still lies upon the town! Avenging spirits hover
over the spot where the victim fell, and lie in wait for the returning
murderer.

FAUST

That, too, from thee? Murder and death of a world upon thee, monster!
Take me thither, I say, and liberate her!

MEPHISTOPHELES

I will convey thee there; and hear, what I can do! Have I all the power
in Heaven and on Earth? I will becloud the jailer's senses: get
possession of the key, and lead her forth with human hand! I will keep
watch: the magic steeds are ready, I will carry you off. So much is in
my power.

FAUST

Up and away!

NIGHT

OPEN FIELD

(FAUST _and_ MEPHISTOPHELES _speeding onward on black horses_.)


FAUST

What weave they there round the raven-stone?


MEPHISTOPHELES

I know not what they are brewing and doing.


FAUST

Soaring up, sweeping down, bowing and bending!


MEPHISTOPHELES

A witches'-guild.


FAUST

They scatter, devote and doom!


MEPHISTOPHELES

On! on!

DUNGEON

FAUST

(_with a bunch of keys and a lamp, before an iron door_)

A shudder, long unfelt, comes o'er me;
Mankind's collected woe o'erwhelms me, here.
She dwells within the dark, damp walls before me,
And all her crime was a delusion dear!
What! I delay to free her?
I dread, once again to see her?
On! my shrinking but lingers Death more near.

(_He grasps the lock: the sound of singing is heard inside_.)

     _My mother, the harlot,
     Who put me to death;
     My father, the varlet,
     Who eaten me hath!
     Little sister, so good,
     Laid my bones in the wood,
     In the damp moss and clay:_
     _Then was I a beautiful bird o' the wood;
     Fly away! Fly away_!

FAUST _(unlocking)_

She does not dream her lover listens near;
That he the rattling chain, the rustling straw, can hear.

_(He enters_.)

MARGARET (_hiding herself on the pallet_)
Woe! woe! They come. O death of bitterness!

FAUST (_whispering_)
Hush! hush! The hour is come that frees thee.

MARGARET (_throwing herself before him_)
Art thou a man, then pity my distress!

FAUST
Thy cries will wake the guards, and they will seize thee!
(_He takes hold of the fetters to unlock them_.)

MARGARET (_on her knees_)

Who, headsman! unto thee such power
Over me could give?
Thou'rt come for me at midnight-hour:
Have mercy on me, let me live!
Is't not soon enough when morning chime has run?

(_She rises_.)

And I am yet so young, so young!
And now Death comes, and ruin!
I, too, was fair, and that was my undoing.
My love was near, but now he's far;
Torn lies the wreath, scattered the blossoms are.
Seize me not thus so violently!
Spare me! What have I done to thee?
Let me not vainly entreat thee!
I never chanced, in all my days, to meet thee!


FAUST

Shall I outlive this misery?


MARGARET

Now am I wholly in thy might.
But let me suckle, first, my baby!
I blissed it all this livelong night;
They took 't away, to vex me, maybe,
And now they say I killed the child outright.
And never shall I be glad again.
They sing songs about me! 'tis bad of the folk to do it!
There's an old story has the same refrain;
Who bade them so construe it?


FAUST (_falling upon his knees_)

Here lieth one who loves thee ever,
The thraldom of thy woe to sever.


MARGARET (_flinging herself beside him_)

O let us kneel, and call the Saints to hide us!
Under the steps beside us,
The threshold under,
Hell heaves in thunder!
The Evil One
With terrible wrath
Seeketh a path
His prey to discover!

FAUST (_aloud_)

Margaret! Margaret!


MARGARET (_attentively listening_)

That was the voice of my lover!

(_She springs to her feet: the fetters fall off_.)

Where is he? I heard him call me.
I am free! No one shall enthrall me.
To his neck will I fly,
On his bosom lie!
On the threshold he stood, and _Margaret_! calling,
Midst of Hell's howling and noises appalling,
Midst of the wrathful, infernal derision,
I knew the sweet sound of the voice of the vision!


FAUST

'Tis I!

MARGARET

      'Tis thou! O, say it once again!

    (_Clasping him_.)

'Tis he! 'tis he! Where now is all my pain?
The anguish of the dungeon, and the chain?
'Tis thou! Thou comest to save me,
And I am saved!--
Again the street I see
Where first I looked on thee;
And the garden, brightly blooming,
Where I and Martha wait thy coming.


FAUST (_struggling to leave_)

Come! Come with me!


MARGARET

                    Delay, now!
So fain I stay, when thou delayest!

  (_Caressing him_.)


FAUST

Away, now!
If longer here thou stayest,
We shall be made to dearly rue it.

MARGARET

Kiss me!--canst no longer do it?
My friend, so short a time thou'rt missing,
And hast unlearned thy kissing?
Why is my heart so anxious, on thy breast?
Where once a heaven thy glances did create me,
A heaven thy loving words expressed,
And thou didst kiss, as thou wouldst suffocate me--
Kiss me!
Or I'll kiss thee!

(_She embraces him_.)

Ah, woe! thy lips are chill,
And still.
How changed in fashion
Thy passion!
Who has done me this ill?

(_She turns away from him_.)

FAUST

Come, follow me! My darling, be more bold:
I'll clasp thee, soon, with warmth a thousand-fold;
But follow now! 'Tis all I beg of thee.

MARGARET (_turning to him_)

And is it thou? Thou, surely, certainly?

FAUST

'Tis I! Come on!

MARGARET

Thou wilt unloose my chain,
And in thy lap wilt take me once again.
How comes it that thou dost not shrink from me?--
Say, dost thou know, my friend, whom thou mak'st free?

FAUST

Come! come! The night already vanisheth.


MARGARET

My mother have I put to death;
I've drowned the baby born to thee.
Was it not given to thee and me?
Thee, too!--'Tis thou! It scarcely true doth seem--
Give me thy hand! 'Tis not a dream!
Thy dear, dear hand!--But, ah, 'tis wet!
Why, wipe it off! Methinks that yet
There's blood thereon.
Ah, God! what hast thou done?
Nay, sheathe thy sword at last!
Do not affray me!


FAUST

O, let the past be past!
Thy words will slay me!


MARGARET

No, no! Thou must outlive us.
Now I'll tell thee the graves to give us:
Thou must begin to-morrow
The work of sorrow!
The best place give to my mother,
Then close at her side my brother,
And me a little away,
But not too very far, I pray!
And here, on my right breast, my baby lay!
Nobody else will lie beside me!--
Ah, within thine arms to hide me,
That was a sweet and a gracious bliss,
But no more, no more can I attain it!
I would force myself on thee and constrain it,
And it seems thou repellest my kiss:
And yet 'tis thou, so good, so kind to see!


FAUST

If thou feel'st it is I, then come with me!


MARGARET

Out yonder?


FAUST

To freedom.


MARGARET

  If the grave is there,
Death lying in wait, then come!
From here to eternal rest:
No further step--no, no!
Thou goest away! O Henry, if I could go!


FAUST

Thou canst! Just will it! Open stands the door.


MARGARET

I dare not go: there's no hope any more.
Why should I fly? They'll still my steps waylay!
It is so wretched, forced to beg my living,
And a bad conscience sharper misery giving!
It is so wretched, to be strange, forsaken,
And I'd still be followed and taken!


FAUST

I'll stay with thee.


MARGARET

Be quick! Be quick!
Save thy perishing child!
Away! Follow the ridge
Up by the brook,

[Illustration: _=If the grave is there,
Death lying in wait, then come=_!]

Over the bridge,
Into the wood,
To the left, where the plank is placed
In the pool!
Seize it in haste!
'Tis trying to rise,
'Tis struggling still!
Save it! Save it!


FAUST

Recall thy wandering will!
One step, and thou art free at last!


MARGARET

If the mountain we had only passed!
There sits my mother upon a stone,--
I feel an icy shiver!
There sits my mother upon a stone,
And her head is wagging ever.
She beckons, she nods not, her heavy head falls o'er;
She slept so long that she wakes no more.
She slept, while we were caressing:
Ah, those were the days of blessing!


FAUST

Here words and prayers are nothing worth;
I'll venture, then, to bear thee forth.


MARGARET

No--let me go! I'll suffer no force!
Grasp me not so murderously!
I've done, else, all things for the love of thee.


FAUST

The day dawns: Dearest! Dearest!

MARGARET

Day? Yes, the day comes,--the last day breaks for me!
My wedding-day it was to be!
Tell no one thou has been with Margaret!
Woe for my garland! The chances
Are over--'tis all in vain!
We shall meet once again,
But not at the dances!
The crowd is thronging, no word is spoken:
The square below
And the streets overflow:
The death-bell tolls, the wand is broken.
I am seized, and bound, and delivered--
Shoved to the block--they give the sign!
Now over each neck has quivered
The blade that is quivering over mine.
Dumb lies the world like the grave!

FAUST

O had I ne'er been born!

MEPHISTOPHELES (_appears outside_)

Off! or you're lost ere morn.
Useless talking, delaying and praying!
My horses are neighing:
The morning twilight is near.

MARGARET

What rises up from the threshold here?
He! he! suffer him not!
What does he want in this holy spot?
He seeks me!


FAUST

Thou shalt live.

MARGARET

Judgment of God! myself to thee I give.


MEPHISTOPHELES (_to_ FAUST)

Come! or I'll leave her in the lurch, and thee!


MARGARET

Thine am I, Father! rescue me!
Ye angels, holy cohorts, guard me,
Camp around, and from evil ward me!
Henry! I shudder to think of thee.


MEPHISTOPHELES

She is judged!


VOICE (_from above_)

         She is saved!


MEPHISTOPHELES (_to_ FAUST)

                     Hither to me!

(_He disappears with_ FAUST.)


VOICE (_from within, dying away_)

Henry! Henry!
