FIRST PART OF THE TRAGEDY 
THE STUDY 
THE STUDY 
(_In the meantime the young apes have been playing with a 
(_The_ WITCH, _with many ceremonies, pours the drink into a 
_Ah, tara, lara, da_! 
_Ah, tara, lara da_! 
        In the Castle by the Sea. 
Who had a big black flea-- 
     Who had a big black flea, 
        And sinking deep in the sea: 
  An eternal sea, 
From sea to land, from land to sea. 
Dame Martha! 
            Hurrah--tarara-la! 
            Hurrah--tarara-la! 
            Hurrah--tarara-la! 
            Hurrah--tarara-la! 
It was a blow that went through every limb! 
        Out of Corruption's womb: 
Be still, old wine-tub. 
Now, what shall come of this? the creatures antic, 
The crazy stuff, the gestures frantic,-- 
(_who up to this time have been making all kinds of fantastic 
My little sister's dead. 
Thy sense is shut, thy heart is dead: 
In smoke and mould the fleshless dead 
FAUST (_with averted head_) 
        My poor weak head 
[Illustration: _Roll the devilish eyes wrathfully in thy head_] 
As if a mill-wheel whirled in my head! 
          "Now, you I call a stupid-head!" 
Turn off this spirit from his fountain-head; 
(_Pours a glass of wine over_ BRANDER'S _head_.) 
And the others are now so far ahead! 
     Woman's a thousand steps ahead. 
I, image of the Godhead! 
'Tis written on his very forehead 
Cloud and trailing mist o'erhead 
The ranks of living creatures thou dost lead 
"In the Beginning was the _Power,"_ I read. 
She in my mask a hidden sense would read: 
Who, now, a work of moderate sense will read? 
'Twas sure an old Greek tragedy you read? 
     When towards the Devil's House we tread, 
Since now it stands one in good stead. 
Alas! in living Nature's stead, 
So long I stumble, ill bestead, 
Why howl, you women there? Instead, 
He takes these gaudy people instead. 
     And soon enough the poor beast had, 
          Around the linden lass and lad 
          Already footed it like mad: 
     He whirled and jumped, with torment mad, 
love-mad. 
The Blocksberg has a summit broad, 
Spider's foot and paunch of toad, 
Now she is lively, mostly sad, 
(_He throws himself into a leathern arm-chair near the bed_.) 
     Were plagued, awake and in bed; 
        Already on my bed. 
As if in Spanish boots 'twere laced, 
Some baubles I therein had placed, 
To the left, where the plank is placed 
There will your mind be drilled and braced, 
No test or trial you evaded: 
It seems the business has succeeded. 
And so, but little time is needed, 
The poodle naught remarked, as after thee he speeded; 
By bodies is its course impeded; 
A Helping God the helper aided. 
I've almost for Theology decided. 
I should not wish to see you here misguided: 
To be our peer, with us, the Spirits, banded? 
And thus, my own sole self to all their selves expanded, 
And shaped and cherished--which with joy expanded, 
I too, at last, shall with them all be stranded! 
The world's, as well, must soon be ended. 
So that he felt it till his days were ended. 
This was the medicine--the patients' woes soon ended, 
          Gloriously ended! 
Now for the last time I've the witches'-hill ascended: 
          Christ is ascended! 
The lofty works, uncomprehended, 
Though still by them uncomprehended, 
As he in Naples wandered round, unfriended; 
Our converse here must be suspended. 
That so our learned talk might be extended. 
Might I again presume, with trust unbounded, 
When the strife's compounded. 
To hear your wisdom thoroughly expounded? 
Must fifty years be rounded: 
Yet always doesn't the thing succeed. 
Yet through delivery orators succeed; 
With this fair girl will not succeed; 
I feel that I am far behind, indeed. 
And the damned throw of dice, indeed. 
So innocent is she, indeed, 
And not for death, indeed. 
And as regards the younger folk, indeed, 
Perhaps the very Devil, indeed! 
That were to venture far, indeed. 
Is it the _Thought_ which works, creates, indeed? 
Now that thou art a whore indeed, 
So this advice I bid thee heed-- 
Most Worthy Pedagogue, take heed! 
And treated _your_ slips with as little heed. 
But fifteen minutes' time is all I need; 
That to confess she had no need. 
Do I not always share her need? 
With any--only satisfy our need. 
Speak out, and make your choice with speed! 
For our fine trip, meanwhile, prepare thyself with speed! 
The wild stag's speed, 
I tell you, once for all, that speed 
Air in leaves, and wind in reed, 
The courage of the lion's breed, 
She is judged! 
(_After the holes have been bored and plugged_) 
The lamp's extinguished!-- 
Whence all the world is cheered and edified. 
And, if thou art satisfied, 
If thou therewith art fully satisfied, 
With a good mouthful I must be supplied. 
Thus the best beverage is supplied, 
Well-made you are, 'tis not to be denied, 
Health to the man, so skilled and tried. 
A third time itching to be tried? 
Don't swarm so round the Naked! 
Ancestral lumber, stuffed and packed-- 
With glasses, boxes, round me stacked, 
True, with the child a troubled life I led, 
And him, with thee, be downward led; 
Her little world therein concealed. 
The might of Man, as in the Bard revealed. 
What do I see? What heavenly form revealed 
Good! the method is revealed 
     The maids were bitten and bled. 
Bliss grows apace, and then its course is jangled; 
And by degrees your heart is tangled; 
When some poor maiden was beguiled! 
But soon to seek them is beguiled. 
How scornfully I once reviled, 
As Orpheus' lyre the brutes compelled, 
On fire each mountain-peak, with peace each valley filled, 
My steps by one slight obstacle controlled,-- 
     Things are badly controlled, 
Eternal, swift, are onward whirled! 
By Nature's listless hand the thread is twirled, 
In sullen jangle are together hurled, 
And instruments together hurled, 
Against the rocks' deep bases hurled, 
     In ruin 'tis hurled, 
Before him I should blush, ashamed. 
Before no king that could be named! 
In truth, 'tis well and fitly timed, 
FAUST (_overwhelmed_) 
Now again requickened, 
What happened? 
And how the Devil jests, be now enlightened! 
Was that your nose I tightened? 
Behind the stove still banned, 
Sways like a harp-string by the breezes fanned. 
Howe'er for them one may have worked and planned? 
And the stern heart is tenderly unmanned. 
In Hell itself, then, laws are reckoned? 
The God, above my powers enthroned, 
The few, who thereof something really learned, 
If Thou hadst not all merriment unlearned. 
Have evermore been crucified and burned. 
With lofty speech, though by them scorned and spurned: 
The God that in my breast is owned 
And, lacking blossoms, blue, yellow, and red, 
        The morning sun shone red: 
To bathe thy breast in morning-red!" 
How she stared and glared! 
Here winds away, and in a hundred 
He lied! What! On the brink of death he slandered? 
Which through the holy spheres of Nature groped and wandered, 
In the last throes his senses wandered, 
And honestly, in his own fashion, pondered 
There, in a corner pressed and sundered, 
     The scattered 
If still they live, wide through the world are scattered. 
Frightened, the owlets are scattered: 
     By the blow of a demigod shattered! 
Hearken! the pillars are shattered. 
And those beside, whose joy my Song so flattered, 
I am seized, and bound, and delivered-- 
Now over each neck has quivered 
To clear the folly out, how have I swept and stirred! 
He'll be of spirits and of Spirit cured. 
The solace this, whereof he's most assured: 
He calls it Reason--thence his power's increased, 
Already there, with curious eyebrows raised, 
No hand with loving pressure closed; 
The body sweet, beside which I reposed! 
How, in crowds together massed, 
Worse than the pestilence, have passed. 
If the mountain we had only passed! 
Its perfect stature stands at last confessed! 
          All for the dance the shepherd dressed, 
The Words of the Four be addressed: 
A garter that her knee has pressed! 
By all things saddened and oppressed; 
So, by the burden of my days oppressed, 
A heaven thy loving words expressed, 
Whereby the nature usually is expressed. 
Thy wish be on Walpurgis Night expressed; 
The timid lips have stammeringly expressed,-- 
By turns in either bridal chamber housed. 
Within the Lily's tepid bath espoused, 
The dog, when he's well educated, 
Could such a spirit be so cheated? 
Am I again so foully cheated? 
And all of life for all mankind created 
Must something clever be created. 
'Twere better, then, were naught created. 
For cool, eternal rest created. 
I wish the crowd to feel itself well treated, 
Irregular ways I've always hated; 
Can Earth with such a thing be mated? 
Learn how we were mated! 
My powers I have not rashly estimated: 
Where we originated; 
Are now illuminated: 
For in the rat by poison bloated 
And all is dissipated. 
Thus, all which you as Sin have rated,-- 
Consider well: my memory good is rated. 
As glittering gallants rated. 
First be separated! 
Within a grave well consecrated, 
With eloquence exaggerated? 
Is by the wisest tolerated. 
My bosom, of its thirst for knowledge sated, 
The terms with graver, quill, or chisel, stated? 
I want his death in the weekly paper stated. 
Me hast thou long with might attracted, 
Long from my sphere thy food exacted, 
Has not your heart been anywhere subjected? 
Wherein the Ages are reflected. 
(_The caldron, which the_ SHE-APE _has up to this time neglected 
And yet, there's nothing I've collected-- 
Speak plainly, Sir, have you no one detected? 
Are now a book with seven seals protected: 
Which has not, once, sore hurt inflicted 
The posts are set, the booth of boards completed. 
Inspect the thing: the drawing's not completed. 
Has not Sir Mammon grandly lighted 
     Tendrils unblighted! 
Show yourselves, delighted! 
Thy palate then with taste delighted, 
And, if it last, wilt soon be plighted 
     Lovers are plighted, 
A quiet hour, to see us fondly plighted, 
They are newly plighted. 
Already art thou o'er-excited, 
But that a dream the Devil counterfeited, 
With breast to breast, and soul to soul united? 
The boisterous guests approach that were invited. 
Thy scent will be to bliss invited; 
        Now sits exalted? 
        Burst from the vaulted 
     In the sphere of dreams enchanted. 
To trap him, let thy snares be planted, 
     That our feet be forwards planted 
When, in the spirit of the ages planted, 
Here a middle-peak is planted, 
Enough! What thou hast asked is granted. 
Pardon! a great delight is granted 
Another baffled hope must be lamented: 
When foolish fasts and prayers my life tormented. 
Here from our wandering will we rest contented. 
Not any potent balsam yet invented? 
The pack of devils by no rules is daunted: 
Grasp my skirt with heart undaunted! 
We are so wise, and yet is Tegel haunted. 
How men torment themselves, is all I've noted. 
The bald-pate pot-belly I have noted: 
Of suns and worlds I've nothing to be quoted; 
     Tranquiller-hearted 
At our last interview, before we parted 
     Clouds had departed! 
No doubt 'twas late when you from Rippach started? 
Yet, as I write, a warning is suggested, 
No man the ancient leaven has digested! 
Shall not, henceforth, from any pang be wrested, 
The same tough meat have chewed and tested, 
Shall be within mine inmost being tested: 
That I the sense may not have fairly tested. 
     To entrap us, unresisted: 
     And the roots, like serpents twisted, 
From generation unto generation fitted, 
Let Fancy be with her attendants fitted,-- 
But have a care, lest Folly be omitted! 
All rights and laws are still transmitted 
And I am saved!-- 
         She is saved! 
his belly in the dust before me,--that I may trample him, the outlawed, 
But if you forwards go, his ire is most displayed. 
Called forth, deserve to be destroyed: 
     Thou hast it destroyed, 
        My senses mazed. 
They sit sedate, and hope to be amazed. 
        Is racked and crazed; 
The ladies with themselves, and with their finery, aid, 
Alas! the wings that lift the mind no aid 
          And with his elbow punched a maid, 
        Lets in a maid. 
        That out a maid 
The God, who fashioned youth and maid, 
          He broke the ranks, no whit afraid, 
          The buxom wench, she turned and said: 
I feel as stupid, from all you've said, 
I'm dying! That is quickly said, 
And what we should not, often did; 
And all Thy works, sublime and splendid, 
The angels from his visage splendid 
If then appeared, with colors splendid, 
We've but to make a deposition valid 
That now her husband's limbs, outstretched and pallid, 
But now all things have from their bases slid, 
And justly so: for all things, from the Void 
The rabble by such hate are held, 
Within her cabin on the Alpine field 
Betake thyself to yonder field, 
And bear me to her beauteous field! 
Desert with fame, in Action's every field? 
Then would I see eternal Evening gild 
So from its mother's breasts a child 
Save thy perishing child! 
My tears gush forth: the Earth takes back her child! 
Sound on, ye hymns of Heaven, so sweet and mild! 
A witches'-guild. 
And when your hands unroll some parchment rare and old, 
And richer far than were the old. 
No rest to-night for young or old! 
(_who all at once appears very old_) 
Come, follow me! My darling, be more bold: 
And he wouldn't, else, have been so bold! 
The half are coarse, the half are cold. 
I'll clasp thee, soon, with warmth a thousand-fold; 
Creative Nature to my soul unfold. 
The deep, mysterious miracles unfold. 
        Except the goblet of gold. 
Then, too, I've neither lands nor gold, 
Like sister Margaret, good as gold,-- 
     And had I but gold, 
They start another dance: come now, let us take hold! 
One that to her can a candle hold?" 
Nor the world's least pomp or honor hold-- 
In these pure features I behold 
And much could I in his face behold,-- 
And things, all splendid to behold, 
You're pleased, forsooth, full houses to behold? 
A chimney, also, you behold. 
        The towns in his land he told, 
Then winter nights take loveliness untold, 
Such is my world: and what a world! 
     The beautiful world, 
(_bores: in the meantime one has made the wax stoppers, and 
rise from the caldron. An ape sits beside it, skims it, and 
misery of this single one pierces to the very marrow of my life; and 
Seest thou the black dog coursing there, through corn and 
For that serene and solemn Spirit-Land: 
Loose, Error, from their eyes the band, 
Perchance my love, amid the childish band, 
Here meekly kissed the grandsire's withered hand. 
You two, who oft a helping hand 
Saved by your father's skillful hand, 
And yours that still I have in hand? 
And when the clock strikes, be on hand! 
(_He kisses her hand_.) 
Youth always has the upper hand. 
        In the clasp of his hand, 
(_reversing the brush, which he has been holding in his hand, 
And purple grapes at hand! 
Smiling, the bumper in my hand: 
From Nostradamus' very hand, 
This racking fuss on every hand, 
Back into quiet settle sea and land! 
Fly! Up, and seek the broad, free land! 
But is there one in all the land 
And stayed the plague in all the land. 
Of this, our enterprise, in German land! 
Where am I? What a lovely land! 
See it, an elephant, expand! 
From earthquake, tempest, wave, volcano's brand, 
Thou gav'st me Nature as a kingdom grand, 
But would that I, on mountains grand, 
Like scattered showers of golden sand;-- 
And, for the first time, here I stand 
Amid thy blessed light could stand, 
The rocky ramparts blazing stand. 
Ah, you don't understand! 
Five hours a day, you understand, 
There let, at once, my record end! 
Look yonder! thou canst scarcely see the end: 
The best thou learnest, in the end 
Where'er you touch, there's interest without end. 
O'er books and papers saw me bend; 
Each shares therein, though few may comprehend: 
A friend! 
That is no little space: what say'st thou, friend? 
I gaze, as in the bosom of a friend. 
Ever thine eye, most mournful friend, 
But still the time may reach us, good my friend. 
_District of Schierke and Elend_. 
Let Neighbor Paunch to that attend! 
He snares our feet, some future chain to bind. 
My neighbor's one of them, I find, 
Naught so insipid in the world I find 
Since, in his master's stead, two strangers doth he find. 
And sensibler than I, you'll find. 
A splendid word to serve, you'll find 
No shop, on earth, like this you'll find!-- 
And scents about, his track to find. 
Woe's me, canst thou naught better find! 
Not quite so fast! Two others come behind,-- 
The Day before me and the Night behind, 
(MARGARET _among much people: the_ EVIL SPIRIT _behind_ 
But I am sure--that you are very kind. 
Upon the world, and on mankind. 
MARTHA (_peeping through the blind_) 
I'm sorry I'm so blind: 
Has Nature, then, and has a noble mind 
Yes, out of sight is out of mind! 
For what goes in--or won't go in--your mind. 
Hail him, who keeps a steadfast mind! 
The new-born impulse fires my mind,-- 
Which he, approaching, round us seems to wind? 
The first is free to us; we're governed by the second. 
'Tis for your sweetheart's room you're bound, 
And truly, song must here rebound 
"In her the flower o' the sex is found!" 
Go on! It is a woe profound! 
The awful Night's intense profound: 
The splendor of the world goes round, 
'Mid brother-spheres, his ancient round: 
FAUST (_looking around_) 
pieces, with which they spring around_.) 
Cling! clang! "Here's to her!" went around 
If I am right, we heard the sound 
He ends with step of thunder-sound. 
O God! 
Call it Bliss! Heart! Love! God! 
Believest thou in God? 
Which always wills the Bad, and always works the Good. 
But then one learns to relish rest and food. 
At first, reluctant, takes its food, 
One may possess them, well and good; 
Who comes to you with courage good, 
"My child," she said, "ill-gotten good 
Is for the wench a deal too good. 
     Little sister, so good, 
     O be thou so good 
Sir Baron call me thou, then is the matter good; 
     The wooden table gives wine as good! 
The Key of Solomon is good. 
Each leaf for such a pact is good; 
One's spirits, Sir, are thus not always good, 
The noble Sir should find it good, 
Such to encounter is not good: 
Half sport of childhood, 
A fellow made of genuine flesh and blood 
Upon thy threshold whose the blood? 
Ensnares the soul, consumes the blood. 
Thou hast no doubt about my noble blood: 
And to subscribe thy name thou'lt take a drop of blood. 
     With sweat and with blood 
What helps one's beauty, youthful blood? 
Their blank, set stare benumbs the human blood, 
And ever circulates a newer, fresher blood. 
Somewhat of cash, and healthy blood: 
The love of this young silly blood 
What sweetest thrill is in my blood! 
The Italian's fiery blood, 
For all of thy half-hellish brood 
And that damned stuff, the bestial, human brood,-- 
Part of that Power, not understood, 
     _Then was I a beautiful bird o' the wood; 
     Laid my bones in the wood, 
Into the wood, 
     The grapes are juicy, the vines are wood, 
In air and water and the silent wood. 
You still are here? Nay, 'tis a thing unheard! 
Twill ne'er be clean: why, 'tis a thing unheard! 
Each will the joy of the sunshine hoard, 
Yet am I near, and love keeps watch and ward; 
     Drink, and fly onward-- 
     Fly ever sunward

large ball, which they now roll forward_.) 
VALENTINE (_comes forward_) 
I envy even the Body of the Lord 
It's really kind of such a noble Lord 
To honor the Day of the Risen Lord! 
'Tis written: "In the Beginning was the _Word_." 
Here am I balked: who, now can help afford? 
Vanish, at once! We've said the enlightening word. 
I like, at times, to hear The Ancient's word, 
Yes, child! and let this blossom-word 
The proper folks one's talents laud: 
The angel blossom from the bud.

Though still confused his service unto Me, 
     Feel with polypus-antennae 
Yet in the word must some idea be. 
Yet in thy writing as unwearied be, 
By storm she cannot captured be; 
Let not the chance neglected be! 
But there enigmas also knotted be. 
Sir Microcosm his name should be. 
Among my equals I would be. 
How small the giant lout would be, 
In this game let our Lord God be! 
Well! I'll engage to let thee be: 
Why at the threshold wilt snuffing be? 
If your pairs would loving be, 
That's nothing! One must not so squeamish be; 
His partner in the dance you'll be,-- 
But might, the while, more useful be. 
One yet in growth will ever grateful be. 
That thou hast bored me, I must thankful be! 
No, Lord! I find things, there, still bad as they can be. 
That the wedding golden be. 
Meanwhile, may not the treasure risen be, 
Yet my delight 'twill also be! 
A traveller is so used to be 
I know what science this has come to be. 
Beware, a tinkling fool to be! 
Here I am Man,--dare man to be! 
My wedding-day it was to be! 
From Heaven they represent themselves to be, 
Unto each man his love she seems to be. 
Eavesdropping, ha! thy pleasure seems to be. 
A long-legged grasshopper appears to be, 
And, truly, it would easier be 
That I nor Chancellor nor Kaiser be. 
                Ah, shall there never be 
Though guessed the holy symbols be: 
You see a man, as others be. 
If tightly laced her corsets be. 
     And rich thou 'It be. 
That's well! So might a compact be 
     And two let be, 
If sacred or profane it be; 
'Tis truly wonderful! What can within it be? 
     'Tis done, let it be! 
If the diversion pleasant be. 
And to thine every nod obedient be: 
A little creature 'twill not be, 
And, truly! godless cannot be 
A canine form that cannot be! 
And yet, some hitch in't there must be 
Yet, young and tender though you be, 
Shall that a nosegay be? 
As haply now and then the case may be. 
See, what a delicate race they be! 
Can woman, then, so lovely be? 
What must be, let it quickly be! 
They took 't away, to vex me, maybe, 
When they but look thee in the face:-- 
No--look me, Sirs, straight in the face! 
I tell you, spirits, to your face, 
(_draws a stopper out of the table: fire flies in his face_.) 
Of God, the world and all that in it has a place, 
For me, I grant, sour wine is out of place; 
This bestial noise is out of place. 
"A gift-horse is not out of place, 
I give to spirit-despotism no place; 
And shifted round from place to place. 
I find it good: for that's your proper place. 
And claims of Mother Night her ancient place. 
Nor at the altar take thy place! 
But Margaret thought, with sour grimace, 
When to our booth the current sets apace, 
The haughty Light, which now disputes the space, 
Three years is but a little space. 
I need, at least, a fortnight's space, 
Like an eternal sickness of the race,-- 
Of Man, and all that moves the being of his race, 
And, God! who can the field embrace? 
The sacred tones that my soul embrace, 
Squeeze onward through the narrow gate of grace: 
Truly the fabric of mental fleece 
Resembles a weaver's masterpiece, 
     O cast thou the dice! 
Of flies and bed-bugs, frogs and lice, 
The lord of rats and eke of mice, 
     Make me rich in a trice, 
Give us a goblet of the well-known juice! 
Divides, and kindles into rhythmic dance? 
(_To_ FAUST, _who has left the dance_:) 
Plunge we in Time's tumultuous dance, 
Who give me attendance. 
Ho, there! my friend! I'll levy thine attendance: 
To Life it now renews the old allegiance. 
Have I concealed this countenance?-- 
Hear me not falsely, sweetest countenance! 
Where it may throb in grandest consonance? 
Lifts up, and makes a clearance! 
Nor care for the appearance. 
Through honey-dew and fragrance: 
With all your tripping vagrance. 
FAUST (_in the distance_) 
The way we take, our goal is yet some distance. 
When on the spindle, spun to endless distance, 
From an old hag shall I demand assistance? 
How hard it is to compass the assistance 
Wherefore, from Magic I seek assistance, 
DOST thou not wish a broomstick-steed's assistance? 
     Then Hope again lends sweet assistance, 
In the rush and roll of Circumstance! 
Why, all at once, exhaust the joyance? 
Yet, pray, don't take it as annoyance! 
Why waste so vainly thy resplendence? 
Is't life, I ask, is't even prudence, 
I cannot reconcile myself to Jurisprudence. 
Well said! and out with him that takes the least offence! 
I feel so small before others, and thence 
Yes, gracious Sir, in all obedience! 
FAUST (_after a moment's silence_) 
     Commence, 
The throats are tuned, commence! 
                 'Twill shortly recommence: 
Through flat and stale indifference; 
Hast for the scarlet coat no reverence? 
With most foreboding presence? 
And here was wrought, through holier, purer presence, 
Here lay the child, with Life's warm essence 
O no! with gentlemen of such pretence, 
First drives out the soul with rigid persistence; 
He who would study organic existence, 
     One yearns, the rivers of existence, 
So long as in my legs I feel the fresh existence. 
And the discordant tones of all existence 
Must the poor devil quit existence. 
No dog would endure such a curst existence! 
Full thirty years from my existence? 
Would that I had some influence! 
To head and heart, the force, 
No--let me go! I'll suffer no force! 
That I may detect the inmost force 
Whereby one rises to the source! 
The years a double strength produce. 
A glorious dream! though now the glories fade. 
        Beware! the blade 
He'd be a fool! A brisk young blade 
That in the greater world the little worlds are made. 
A fitter woman ne'er was made 
Then 'tis the same as were the step not made; 
Idly to us they come, as to a masquerade, 
It is an old, transmitted trade, 
Perceived the noblest purpose of His trade, 
Has room, elsewhere, to ply his trade. 
To ply the pimp and gypsy trade! 
Would mother came!--where can she bide? 
So let us by the farce abide. 
Will as servant, slave, with thee abide. 
That for our help he long may abide! 
For, if its quality I decide, 
If you but in yourself confide, 
You swaggering fellow, is your hide

Margaret! what's happened thee? 
That of senses and sap has betrayed thee, 
Come! or I'll leave her in the lurch, and thee! 
But one thing more! Beyond all risk to bind thee, 
Let but the Lying Spirit bind thee 
Will as a servant wait behind thee. 
With magic works and shows that blind thee, 
They would persuade thee. 
Among the beggars and cripples hide thee; 
Will willingly walk beside thee,-- 
But in some corner, woe betide thee! 
Thy steps through life, I'll guide thee,-- 
An angel, if like thee! 
Not even like thee! 
Let this warm clasp of hands declare thee 
Is parchment, then, the holy fount before thee, 
No true refreshment can restore thee, 
Set wigs of million curls upon thy head, to raise thee, 
Hear me exorcise thee! 
Now, to undisguise thee, 
Shuddering, refuse thee! 
I have thee! 
Thy cries will wake the guards, and they will seize thee! 
O, now am I sure of thee! 
I've done, else, all things for the love of thee. 
Leave me alone, I beg of thee! 
  Mark this, I beg of thee! 
But follow now! 'Tis all I beg of thee. 
Henry! I shudder to think of thee. 
A girl by the nose is leading thee. 
Thou seest, not vain the threats I bring thee: 
The lovely pictures they shall bring thee, 
That which the dainty spirits sing thee, 
With holy fire I'll scorch and sting thee! 
That fell asleep to long, long torment, and through thee? 
If I must share my chamber with thee, 
I'll stay with thee. 
Then may thine own son afterwards excel thee. 
Then may his teaching cheerfully impel thee: 
The glorified, from thee: 
Half God within thee! 
Look I not, eye to eye, on thee, 
Where first I looked on thee; 
Shame on thee! 
Great good, I hope, the thing will do thee. 
And much good may the liquor do thee! 
This nursing of the pain forego thee, 
Life be at last revealed to thee! 
I freely leave the choice to thee. 
The promise that I make to thee 
Then soon will others come to thee, 
Spare me! What have I done to thee? 
Why so? What has it done to thee? 
Woe to thee! 
Thou art a grandchild, therefore woe to thee! 
As did the Holy Ghost dictate to thee! 
My softest cushion I give to thee. 
What no man ever saw, I'll give to thee. 
The modest truth I speak to thee. 
Thou busy Spirit, how near I feel to thee! 
I've drowned the baby born to thee. 
                          What's that to thee? 
What boon I have, shall then be given unto thee. 
Ha! do I trap thee! 
So much have I already done for thee, 
I feel as though I'd lost my love for thee. 
So the mouse was not gray, enough for thee. 
O, what a blessed luck for thee! 
Would there were other work for thee! 
But in another book 'tis writ for thee, 
Of oil, he paints the spot for thee:-- 
Hush! hush! The hour is come that frees thee. 
Wrath takes thee! 
As best it pleases thee. 
For thee be speech divine! He loves thee! 
Ah, know'st thou what it means? He loves thee! 
Or I'll kiss thee! 
The pentagram prohibits thee? 
Wear shoes an ell in height,--the truth betrays thee, 
Let me not vainly entreat thee! 
I never chanced, in all my days, to meet thee! 
Not thee! 
  Woe! I endure not thee! 
I've heard, most fully, how she drew thee. 
The worst society thou find'st will show thee 
Thy guilty heart shall then dismay thee. 
Shalt not in a golden chain array thee, 
Poodle, stop that howling, prithee! 
     Then laughed the murderess in her glee: 
A little more, and they would bend the knee 
That, from this den released, and free, 
And fill thy goblet full and free! 
An easier space, and from the crowd be free: 
Take me thither! She shall be free! 
Then art thou from thy service free! 
  A shuttle free, 
Whence o'er the heart his empire free? 
What, Sir! you dare to make so free, 
See, now, the race is happy--it is free! 
Drove forth my feet through woods and meadows free, 
Say, dost thou know, my friend, whom thou mak'st free? 
Something immodest or unseemly free? 
He is a friend of mine, with whom it will agree, 
Spouses, who would fain agree, 
Opposing substances agree. 
Thereto I willingly agree, 
It overcomes me in such degree, 
I come, a squire of high degree, 
You've a visitor of high degree. 
        With his knights of high degree, 
By Three and One, and One and Three, 
     Make even three, 
And green alone Life's golden tree. 
     Therein I saw a cloven tree, 
At every step one strikes a rock or tree! 
Sees not the gardener, even while buds his tree, 
     I then beheld an apple-tree, 
Ah, dearest man, if but thy face I see, 
There fire and whirling smoke I see. 
Until, self-pleased, myself I see,-- 
Not a claw, no tail I see! 
Forsooth, if I am all I see, 
Ah, me! this dungeon still I see. 
Naught but a plain black poodle do I see. 
Again the street I see 
Here high and low contented see! 
Absurder than I ever yet did see. 
Ah, look and see--just look and see! 
     We speak and we see, 
Yet, therefore, no whit better men we see: 
Now that's your fault; from you we nothing see, 
Which there, behind, I glimmering see? 
The little world, and then the great, we'll see. 
If Man, that microcosmic fool, can see 
That scarce the world on holidays can see,-- 
And smells each article, to see 
You clasp the swelling hips, to see 
                  I've long been grieved to see 
And yet 'tis thou, so good, so kind to see! 
Within those bushes; I've a mind to see. 
My voice to hear, my countenance to see; 
Terrible to see! 
With fiery eyes, teeth terrible to see: 
I'd like, myself, such a one to see: 
It is so ugly, rough to see! 
'Tis deeds that I prefer to see: 
Thou goest, they stand in rows to see, 
Us as little insects see! 
And thou mine arts with joy shalt see: 
And yet the summit cannot see: 
No skinflint bargain shalt thou see. 
And thus the pious man you see 
The outer angle, you may see, 
Still wonder at your flights, enjoy the show they see: 
The sturdiest he-goat I would gladly see: 
Here lies one dead already--see! 
I never could learn the ways of life. 
Throbs to life! 
Invisible, visible, round thy life? 
Out of this lonely life

Into the world of strife,

My servant, he! 
A poor, unknowing child! and he--

        And never more drank he! 
     And then as sore oppressed was he 
Surely a gallant man was he, 
Things worsen,--what improvement names he? 
When once inside the door comes he, 
That is the maid! the man is he! 
Obedience, more than ever, claims he, 
The elements of Life how conquers he?

And when upon his rump the leeches hang and fuddle,

Wait a while! 
     And the fire-flies wink and darkle, 
Impotent showers of sleet that darkle 
     Crowded swarms that soar and sparkle, 
But the sun will permit no white to sparkle; 
Take him to the Northern Pole, 
All sorts of tender rigmarole, 
And if the wine be good, our praises shall be ample. 
Follow the ancient text, and the snake thou wast ordered to trample! 
But do not give too very small a sample; 
With all thy likeness to God, thou'lt yet be a sorry example!

(_In_ FAUST'S _long mantle_.) 
Thy prayers didst prattle, 
     He knows not the kettle! 
And sit down on the settle! 
With all my heart! Now, here's a bottle, 
Wherefrom, sometimes, I wet my throttle, 
        There was a King in Thule, 
spirits, and to condemning, unfeeling Man! And thou hast lulled me, 
I was confused, the like ne'er happened me; 
She has scored and has flayed me: 
Was it not given to thee and me? 
One ruin whelm both her and me! 
My wits, be certain, will befriend me. 
Thy cap and mantle straightway lend me! 
Ye angels, holy cohorts, guard me, 
Camp around, and from evil ward me! 
With turned-up nose each scamp may face me, 
With sneers and stinging taunts disgrace me, 
That I so boldly introduce me, 
See the wounds she has made me! 
Ah, within thine arms to hide me, 
Nobody else will lie beside me!-- 
To health in thy dewy fountains bathe me! 
And, freed from the fumes of lore that swathe me, 
Canst thou with lying flattery rule me, 
The woe, the rapture, so ensnare me, 
Which every valley richly bore me! 
Then bright mist veiled the world before me, 
The stubborn rocks before me 
She dwells within the dark, damp walls before me, 
I beg you, ladies, to excuse me. 
And thou didst kiss, as thou wouldst suffocate me-- 
Where once a heaven thy glances did create me, 
New strength and heart to meet the world incite me, 
Neither scruples nor doubts come now to smite me, 
And though the shock of storms may smite me, 
Despite me! 
The woe of earth, the bliss of earth, invite me, 
Thine am I, Father! rescue me! 
Only he loved to roam and leave me, 
Seeing, hearing, and thinking leave me. 
'Tis thou! Thou comest to save me, 
Therefore I'd never love, believe me! 
No, no! The paragon of all, believe me, 
A loss like this to death would grieve me. 
And when the lecture-halls receive me, 
One rapid glance within the mirror give me, 
As was my first, this world will hardly give me. 
I brought it up, and it was fond of me. 
It's too much, even for the like of me. 
Have led thy life, bereft of me? 
Help, Devil! through the coming pangs to push me; 
Let fall on me her fate, and also crush me,-- 
Above me heaven unfurled, the floor of waves beneath me,-- 
Of wings to lift the body can bequeath me. 
Thy powerful yearning moveth me, 
Come! Come with me! 
If thou feel'st it is I, then come with me! 
Mother is much too close with me. 
These crazy signs of witches' craft repel me! 
Then thou, at will, mayst question and compel me. 
Where is he? I heard him call me. 
I am free! No one shall enthrall me. 
Some pleasant news, at least, to tell me. 
I shall recover, dost thou tell me, 
Canst thou with rich enjoyment fool me, 
meanwhile, with the most insipid dissipations, hast concealed from me 
How comes it that thou dost not shrink from me?-- 
My breath takes from me, 
This once, the fancy wrought in me 
Whereto yearns every sense within me? 
The crown of all humanity to win me, 
So you but think a moment's space on me, 
False calves these many years upon me. 
Imprison me! 
'Twould only make the people shun me; 
Where art thou, Faust, whose voice has pierced to me, 
And many a comrade praised to me 
Posterity! Don't name the word to me!

     A dissolute dream once came to me: 
     A lovely dream once came to me;

Thou nam'st thyself a part, yet show'st complete to me? 
But _the Golden_ give to me, 
Madam, it is a grief to me; 
The jewels don't belong to me. 
I swear to you, 'tis like a dream to me. 
And if, this moment, came she in to me, 
If that prevents, how cam'st thou in to me? 
There com'st thou, hopping on to me! 
But what is all your fun to me? 
You rail, and it is fun to me. 
Omniscient am I not; yet much is known to me. 
                     Hither to me! 
And thus, thou'rt prisoner to me? 
My brother! God! such words to me? 
The one who brought such things to me." 
I must confess, it seems to me 
There, also, comes no rest to me, 
Attention! Hearken now to me! 
'Tis honor, profit, unto me. 
Then Time be finished unto me! 
Must leave, I fear me. 
One of us, dost hear me! 
I'll no longer suffer near me. 
That from her gaze I cannot tear me! 
And I, God's hate flung o'er me, 
A shudder, long unfelt, comes o'er me; 
Your courtesy doth flatter me: 
Clouds gather over me-- 
Oh, if you hear me, answer me! 
Why, just such talk as this, for me, 
Both clear and muddy streams, for me 
Then shalt thou do the same for me. 
I felt a world arise for me. 
At least, I hold it so much gain for me, 
Day? Yes, the day comes,--the last day breaks for me! 
I feel, the gentleman allows for me, 
Let that day be the last for me! 
This knotted staff suffices me. 
He loves me! 
And seizes me! 
He seeks me! 
Who calls me? 
Kiss me! 
Go! you'll laugh at me. 
Were I in _your_ place, do not doubt me, 
But knowledge worth having I fain would get me. 
My mother was hardly willing to let me; 
No crash of shipwreck shall have power to fright me! 
Nor Hell nor Devil can longer affright me. 
Are not their forces also lent me? 
Not me! 
Then to the cave secure thou leadest me, 
                   Thus thou pleasest me. 
Thou must! thou must! and though my life it cost me! 
I feel thee draw my heart, absorb, exhaust me: 
I won't go there, your jolly rows disgust me! 
And jolly rows and squabbles, trust me! 
And for another keep, meanwhile, my eyes about me. 
Come in, but gently: follow me! 
Upon my couch of sleep I lay me: 
Thy words will slay me! 
But some wild dream is sent to fray me. 
Do not affray me! 
Hasn't done his duty by me! 
As through the garden-gate I came? 
What is that? God in Heaven! Whence came

As the first they must everywhere shine, 
Will that, too, prompt this heart of thine? 
Thou, Hell, hast claimed this sacrifice as thine! 
And head and virile forces--thine: 
Yea, if a magic mantle once were mine, 
There never was a sweeter fool than mine, 
The blade that is quivering over mine. 
You wanted them: I've given you mine. 
Is't thence less wholly mine? 
And as for bread, around a baker's door, in famine, 
She and her peace I yet must undermine: 
I feel impelled, its meaning to determine,-- 
The heart that on the dew of hope must pine! 
That breathes throughout this hallowed shrine! 
With impulse, mystic and divine, 
And he treated her always to pies and wine, 
I glow, as drunk with new-made wine: 
And yet it seemed as I were drinking wine.

Twice a swine!

Nay, fear him not, my sweetest one!

     This is the witch's once-one's-one! 
Hell's fugitive stray-one?

        The pangs that wring my flesh and bone! 
_That_ knowledge cuts me to the bone. 
What shall therewith be done? 
     See, thus it's done! 
As his repulsive face has done. 
What's done has happed--what haps, is done! 
And truly 'tis not much, when all is done. 
        When once 'tis done 
And quicker yet 'tis done. 
Hast thou done? 
Ah, God! what hast thou done? 
The monkey! Is she gone? 
Besides, he's gone. 
        My peace is gone, 
        My peace is gone, 
        My peace is gone, 
So now, at the end, the flower is gone. 
As early to my clouded sight ye shone! 
     And there two fairest apples shone: 
Were but the ear-rings mine, alone! 
Not Art and Science serve, alone; 
(_at the spinning-wheel, alone_) 
Is in the beast: I see but drill, alone. 
But _Devil_ rhymes with _Doubt_ alone, 
No doubt you're much alone? 
You each, at home, are quite enough alone. 
The faith alone 
And so I nursed it all alone 
        For him alone; 
I hold the sceptre, here,--and lack the crown alone. 
Wherefore the hag, and her alone? 
Poor Son of Earth, how couldst thou thus alone 
Here, lost in thought, I've lingered oft alone, 
Toad-like, thy nourishment alone? 
In smaller circles one is not alone. 
Ah, if I only slept alone! 
I peeped at the owl in her nest alone: 
        Knowest Thou, and Thou alone! 
How grand a show! but, ah! a show alone. 
     And ten is none. 
So sit I, like the King upon his throne: 
There is, again, thy proper tone!-- 
I'm tired enough of this dry tone,-- 
There sits my mother upon a stone, 
There sits my mother upon a stone,-- 
Why suck'st, from sodden moss and dripping stone, 
And one is almost turned to stone. 
A few more steps ascend, as far as yonder stone!-- 
O'er the Ilsen-stone. 
What weave they there round the raven-stone? 
With youth and revel round you like a zone: 
And sway me from your misty, shadowy zone! 
Woe! 
Woe! woe! 
     Woe! woe! 
Perhaps he's even dead! Ah, woe!-- 
You're ravished quite, then comes a touch of woe, 
For the last time beheld my woe! 
And so we'll choose ourselves a Pope. 
Yet also we must have a ruling head, I hope, 
Ladies with him delighted are. 
     All in the air are 
ones, sits near and warms himself. Ceiling and walls are 
Torn lies the wreath, scattered the blossoms are. 
A starveling flame, ye blow it bare! 
Gave us so much of helping care. 
     We do not measure with such care: 
Nathless a parchment, writ and stamped with care, 
A fair young damsel took him in her care, 
And home I can go without your care. 
But none the more do others care. 
In exercising, with the strictest care, 
     If him------------------does not scare. 
My darling, who shall dare 
You cook the scraps from others' fare; 
A good man does his honest share 
That now our day of joy you share, 
Come, come along! It _must_ be, I declare! 
It's really shameful, I declare;-- 
My final ruin then declare! 
Ask priest or sage the answer to declare, 
One dares not that before chaste ears declare, 
     Like the fox in a snare, 
When she succeeds therewith a youth to snare, 
     Change place, and sense ensnare! 
Yet I betimes myself prepare 
Chiefly, enough of incident prepare! 
     Let him a-----------prepare, 
Of all I've seen, beyond compare; 
Which chaste hearts, notwithstanding, cannot spare; 
They come to look, and they prefer to stare. 
If him she gets, why let her beware! 
Here! 
And come, devoted and sincere, 
They're poets, genuine and sincere. 
     Accurs√©d fere! 
Mankind's collected woe o'erwhelms me, here. 
A dog thou seest, and not a phantom, here! 
It is so close, so sultry, here! 
A short time, only, am I here, 
What rises up from the threshold here? 
And here! 
        Thus is He here! 
     Only believe there's a miracle here! 
Yet in the ranks, at once, we're here 
        Still are we native here. 
Tis vain, this empty brooding here, 
Still many a man stands living here, 
And yet I cannot gain them here. 
I'll bring him here. 
I'll cut away, betimes, from here: 
Let us, with speed, away from here! 
To give that number is the custom here: 
I feel as if the organ here 
A single hour they've not been here. 
          Now, don't be so familiar here! 
Is there a magic vapor here? 
Who lies here? 
        The grave is here; 
What place of martyrdom is here! 
     What is that here? 
Bring me a gimlet here! 
        What dost thou here 
     Who are you here? 
In place of cheering drink, which one seeks vainly here, 
To order rigidly adhere; 
Thus, in our booth's contracted sphere, 
We'll try a wider sphere. 
Are we the sport of every changeful atmosphere? 
Let them drop down the golden atmosphere, 
Halt, there! Ho, there! 
Just see those handsome fellows, there! 
Instead of shooting here and there, 
     Be here--and there! 
I'll go ahead and introduce thee there, 
Both ease and grace will fail me there. 
Who's there? 
Hold fast, lest thou be hurled down the abysses there! 
  If the grave is there,

And in enjoyment pine to feel desire. 
I'm she: what does the gentleman desire?

Too young, to be without desire.

This was the poodle's real core, 
They're from the Rhine! I guessed as much, before. 
I stand, no wiser than before: 
The learned gentleman I bow before: 
A most offensive song! Thank God, each morning, therefore, 
And is not apt, without a why or wherefore, 
And here, poor fool! with all my lore 
Refreshment shall his lips in vain implore-- 
Let us the sensual deeps explore, 
Its germs, productive powers explore, 
So, dream thy dreams, O Faust, until we meet once more! 
The wider circle he acquires, the more 
And he lamented his ill fortune all the more. 
And thanked no less, and thanked no more 
And rummage in empty words no more! 
She slept so long that she wakes no more. 
Thou gav'st the comrade, whom I now no more 
Miserable Faust! I know thee now no more. 
And fancies there are no favors more, 
I dare not go: there's no hope any more. 
        Ah, nevermore! 
        Ah, nevermore! 
        Ah, nevermore! 
        Departeth nevermore! 
To stick in shallow trash forevermore,-- 
Still were he lost forevermore! 
What seek I? Why so full my heart, and sore? 
        My heart is sore: 
        My heart is sore: 
        My heart is sore: 
Besides, his penitence was very sore, 
Nor honors, save for him in store; 
Through the impervious veil it wore!

I verily see a theatre. 
Cursed, also, Hope!--cursed Faith, the spectre! 
I'd praise you if I found you snugly in the centre, 
On _words_ let your attention centre! 
I, for a time, at least, have worked thy cure; 
Past earthly joys he might secure. 
But such a course thou wilt not long endure; 
As forwards, onwards, ever must endure; 
I'll not be led by any lure 
Though ugly faces he allure, 
They go their way with looks demure, 
'Twas something better than manure,-- 
So sweetly virtuous and pure, 
Ariel's song is heavenly-pure, 
The Devil must be something, sure,-- 
Half-rotten straw: and yet, he died a Christian, sure, 
To madness and to horror, sure. 
Had I not been, so hadst thou, sure, 
They praise us half in pity, sure: 
And I shall have thee fast and sure!-- 
And yet a little pert, be sure! 
The gentleman's too kind, I'm sure. 
But they'll accept us, after all, I'm sure. 
And teach thy pulses of youth and pleasure 
What would I not, to give thee pleasure? 
Shalt soon experience the pleasure, 
To share with him the pleasure. 
Yet in each soul is born the pleasure 
And, once for all, I grudge thee not the pleasure 
With every hope of future pleasure, 
And soon thou'lt be aware, with keenest thrills of pleasure, 
I'd treat these worthy guests, with pleasure, 
So I am here with pleasure. 
'Twould bring, for all my sinful pleasure, 
        Calling to pleasure, 
What ails you now? Is't suffering, or pleasure? 
     Has wrought for our pleasure. 
This and the other question, at your pleasure. 
Your company shall give us pleasure. 
To waft me o'er the world at pleasure, 
I came, with lust of instant pleasure, 
Will the dog, like man, snarl _his_ displeasure? 
Of lying to thyself in moderate measure. 
Whisks and whirls in measure: 
Finding them often hard to measure: 
But three drops of it measure, 
Forgiveness in the richest measure. 
Since bravery was paid in fullest measure, 
Breathing her atmosphere in fullest measure. 
     For he, without measure, 
To love by rule, and hate by measure! 
I feel, indeed, that I have made the treasure 
And think they're near the treasure: 
I would not for the costliest stores of treasure-- 
The noble indolence I'll teach thee then to treasure, 
Forfeit so wantonly, to swell your treasure? 
To some from out our cellar's treasure. 
To lift the kettle with its treasure. 
That to the Soldan bore a mighty treasure. 
And if I now sit down in restful leisure, 
To-morrow, though, I'll ask, in Easter leisure, 
Is it permitted that we share your leisure? 
And lie dissolved in dreams of love's sweet leisure! 
Of the Four, no feature 
I've scarce the heart to plague the wretched creature. 
Ah, when one studies thus, a prisoned creature, 
But what do I see in the creature? 
Lurks in the creature. 
To help or convert a fellow-creature. 
Is that in the course of nature? 
Yes, when the priest comedian is by nature, 
Man's misery even to pity moves my nature; 
Come, bind thyself by prompt indenture, 
        Bold is the venture, 
        Bold is the venture, 
In this sense, even, canst thou venture. 
To yield one wholly, and to feel a rapture 
(_With a gesture_:) 
(_He makes an indecent gesture_.) 
When o'er our heads, lost in the vaulted azure, 
To bear false witness in a case? 
But think, the chances of the case! 
As Dilettante I the curtain raise. 
None ever found a thing to praise. 
But time through order may be won, I promise. 
_with great noise_.) 
Reason and Knowledge only thou despise, 
'Tis trying to rise, 
My hands are empty, otherwise. 
Seek thou the honest recompense! 
I see you have your fun at our expense. 
With little art, clear wit and sense 
That, to his hot, insatiate sense, 
     With clearer sense, 
Who knows not their sense 
And, if they've not bewitched my sense, 
And for the sense and power intense 
I've led my scholars by the nose,-- 
I sat in unconcerned repose, 
And heard the swagger as it rose. 
And, haply, ere one travels half the course 
Of course. 
Which binds the world, and guides its course; 
Wherein, Sirs, can I be of use? 
That which one does not know, one needs to use; 
MARTHA (_coming from the house_) 
And when a corpse approaches, close my house: 
It goes with me, as with the cat the mouse. 
When I have sat at some carouse. 
     Through all Heaven impermeate, 
The waggish knave least trouble doth create. 
To restless action spurs our fate! 
And blest is he, who has the lucky fate, 
And Nature shuts on me her gate. 
Out of the hollow, gloomy gate, 
(_They pass in the city-gate_.) 
I see stark-nude young witches congregate, 
Within my deepest, inmost soul I hate. 
If there we cherish love or hate, 
The like of thee have never moved My hate. 
This time, thine eyes be satiate! 
Yes, Sir, 'tis late. 
The motley throngs come forth elate: 
That arbitrarily, here, ourselves we isolate. 
        The man who with thee goes, thy mate, 
     The One, unoriginate, 
You are so kind, compassionate. 
Alack, that men are so unfortunate! 
(_He disappears with_ FAUST: _the revellers start and separate_.) 
             Tis time to separate. 
(_Heaven closes: the_ ARCHANGELS _separate_.) 
You almost like a Frenchman prate; 
Indeed? he'd like mankind to imitate! 
For thou hast torn me from that desperate state 
My proper place is thy estate: 
How is it? under way? and soon complete? 
A contradiction thus complete 
     At once, whene'er they bite! 
     At once, whene'er they bite. 
For what one has, in black and white, 
Much error, and of truth a glimmering mite, 
Nor nearer, to the Infinite, 
"In the Beginning was the _Act_," I write. 
I think, how useful 'tis to write; 
And then, observe for whom you write! 
Without that, I have appetite. 
Enter not so stall-fed quite, 
If one comes bored, exhausted quite, 
Not so: the memory of it touched him quite. 
And mother's case seemed hopeless quite, 
I cannot understand you quite. 
Scattering through gardens and fields remote, 
And yet, from childhood up familiar with the note, 
Quite right! The mark I also note. 
Here, set it in the press, with haste! 
Seize it in haste! 
Don't be a Devil stiff as paste, 
But get fresh jewels to her taste! 
O pardon, Sir, the rough salute! 
     I offer here my best salute 
We will no longer lose a minute; 
I cannot loosen the bonds of the Avenger, nor undo his bolts. Rescue 
     Then honor to whom the honor is due! 
Don't be so proud! I'll hold my tongue, 
How ill it suits the Artist, proud and true! 
God! was so good, so dear, so true! 
Is dead? Alas, that heart so true! 
Yes, the poor women are bad off, 'tis true: 
The Devil taught the thing, 'tis true, 
Age childish makes, they say, but 'tis not true; 
FAUST (_struggling to leave_) 
For further visits thou hast leave. 
Whence, willingly, the comrade him I gave, 
What! shall the Poet that which Nature gave, 
        A golden goblet gave. 
Go, find yourself a more obedient slave! 
  Birth and the Grave, 
I go to God as a soldier brave. 
Unqualified repose he learns to crave; 
Dumb lies the world like the grave! 
Now through the slumber of the grave 
        Was faithful till the grave,-- 
And hope, before my last step to the grave, 
Had he not made himself the Devil's, naught could save 
Yet something from a tour I always save, 
  A fluctuant wave, 
     Look through the sieve! 
What means the sieve? 
Why thou shouldst ask, I don't perceive. 
Judgment of God! myself to thee I give. 
Let us, then, such a drama give! 
Over me could give? 
Must something fresh for their advantage give. 
And each awaits the banquet I shall give. 
So long the host may credit give, 
If unto me full leave you give, 
And so, though even God forgive, 
If I do him wrong, may God forgive! 
And I think the man a knave, as I live! 
On earth a damned existence live! 
Especially since it lives and lets me live; 
Have mercy on me, let me live! 
As long as he on earth shall live, 
Grasp the exhaustless life that all men live! 
Confess, Sirs, I know how to live. 
They merrily and careless live. 
Thou shalt live. 
He shall not leave the spot alive. 
If _he's_ one, let me at him drive! 
     Rapture and Love! 
Along the shining path of Love? 
VOICE (_from above_) 
VOICE (_from above_) 
VOICE (_from above_) 
In brooding souls the sunset burn above? 
MARTHA (_as above_) 
MEPHISTOPHELES (_as above_) 
FAUST (_as above_) 
The whirlpool swirls to get above: 
The other strongly sweeps, this dust above, 
Thou'rt shoved thyself, imagining to shove. 
One with tenacious organs holds in love 
Dear love! 
Art with the Devil hand and glove, 
For this performance I your debtor prove.-- 
          Christ no more found we! 
          Cleanlily wound we: 
Enamored persons here have we, 
That our Papa Satan we 
Must we? 
And yet, this once my thanks I owe 
Ye crowd more near! Then, be the reign assigned ye, 
Shall I attempt, this once, to seize and bind ye? 
Again ye come, ye hovering Forms! I find ye, 
To let it go at last, so please ye, 
Each asks, and presses near to gaze; 
And when the perfect moon before my gaze 
Here burns the glow through film and haze: 
Mammon in the mountain blaze. 
Whence one seeth, with amaze, 
I stand ashamed and in amaze, 
What says the sage, now first I recognize: 
And me, thou angel! didst thou recognize, 
At night, one learns his house to prize:-- 
        His noble size, 
And after--first and foremost duty--Of 
     Wert thou the thief, 
     Know'st thou the thief, 
        Unto no thief 
        Be warm and lief, 
        Love's time is brief: 
(_She springs to her feet: the fetters fall off_.) 
Down with it quickly! Drain it off! 
'Tis very well, that once one tries the stuff, 
of you men runs wild. Why didst thou enter into fellowship with us, if 
What ails thee? What is't gripes thee, elf? 
     Bring help to hearth and shelf. 
Thee, me, Himself? 
(_He disguises himself_.) 
Reveal thyself! 
If I were not a Devil myself! 
(_He seizes the book, and mysteriously pronounces the sign of 
A German can't endure the French to see or hear of, 
What's foreign one can't always keep quite clear of, 
misery,--that the first, in its writhing death-agony under the eyes of 
And the danger to which thou wilt expose thyself? Know that the guilt of 
A horror from the vaulted roof, 
Their very plaudits give my heart a pang, 
And still, alas! the echoes first that rang! 
Uninterrupted gushed and sprang! 
Ah! in the midst of it there sprang 
While yet in joyous growth I sang,-- 
The souls, to whom my earliest songs I sang: 
That in the dance so sweetly sang? 
     To the enticing 
     Whirl of their dancing! 
THE FAIR ONE (_dancing_) 
THE WITCH (_dancing_) 
FAUST (_dancing_) 
     See, the entrancing 
When you have learned, all things reducing, 
That was a promenading! 
At village and dance parading! 
At night, our times of peace abiding. 
Where is he? If I catch the scoundrel hiding, 
And sees all sorts of ships go down the river gliding: 
I saw him with these eyes upon a wine-cask riding 
The All-enfolding, 
From Water, Earth, and Air unfolding, 
It makes me furious, such things beholding: 
The All-upholding, 
     Still increasing and expanding! 
     Tell me, if we still are standing, 
Now we are already again at the end of our wits, where the understanding 
No, no,--no ending! no ending! 
Day after day, the same thing, never-ending. 
Soaring up, sweeping down, bowing and bending! 
Who, in his dusky work-shop bending, 
Here, over this green arbor bending, 
     Waveringly bending, 
     Or if further we're ascending? 
Like heavenly forces rising and descending, 
Their golden urns reciprocally lending, 
     All is turning, whirling, blending, 
     Longing unending 
Made, from his recipes unending, 
See what a vine! what grapes depending! 
And then the marketing and kitchen-tending, 
Thus we, our hellish boluses compounding, 
Among these vales and hills surrounding, 
At once to set about rewarding. 
Methinks, instead of in the forests lording, 
And bear me forth to new and varied being! 
Trembles through all the depths of being, 
Deny His being, 
And shall a promise bind my being? 
'Twixt Heaven and Earth on potent errands fleeing, 
Shall stand, with all my future days agreeing? 
_He_ art thou, who, my presence breathing, seeing, 
Who, feeling, seeing, 
     Thousand-colored, herd-wise hieing 
     Life-ward all hieing,-- 
Thus, at the breasts of Wisdom clinging, 
Hear'st thou voices higher ringing? 
Thou'lt find each day a greater rapture bringing. 
Far away, or nearer singing? 
And feel'st not, thronging 
A chain of deepest action forging 
And with tremendous, oft-repeated urging, 
And rival storms abroad are surging 
For 'tis my pleasure-to behold them surging, 
        And the soldiers go marching, 
And from your heap of ashes hatching 
You sit forever gluing, patching; 
     In the last convulsion twitching. 
My horses are neighing: 
Still in my feet the fright like lead is weighing. 
Each on the other is dashing, 
     Wine, that is dashing 
     Of foaming and flashing 
In frightfully intricate crashing 
I saw, among the rest, a thing 
I'm but a silly, fearsome thing! 
        Good-night to thee, poor thing! 
The poor, poor thing! 
Reprobate! Name not that fairest thing, 
     A hollow thing,-- 
Has given my heart so keen a pang of loathing, 
In all my life there's nothing 
Withdrawn to the mountains, a crownless king: 
Boughs are groaning and breaking, 
The ocean-tides in foam are breaking, 
The evergreen palaces shaking! 
And both, the spheric race partaking, 
FAUST _(awaking)_ 
FAUST _(unlocking)_ 
Only fall to, and show no timid balking. 
But thou hast heard, 'tis not of joy we're talking. 
     'Tis thoughts, and we're thinking! 
I'll teach you how to grin, I'm thinking. 
I'll worm their secret out, I'm thinking. 
That also with them goes material for thinking! 
A fine young fellow's presence, to my thinking, 
That men _will_ have it, there's no blinking: 
Yonder afar, from the hill-paths blinking, 
Sit'st thou, as 'twere an owl a-blinking? 
I fain would drink with you, my glass to Freedom clinking, 
Why here to caverns, rocky hollows slinking, 
Is no one laughing? no one drinking? 
I hasten on, his beams eternal drinking, 
Let me alone! I'll set them first to drinking, 
If 'twere a better wine that here I see you drinking. 
All from the fellowship of fools are shrinking. 
And overladen, nigh to sinking, 
My own head, now, is really nigh to sinking. 
Yet, finally, the weary god is sinking; 
     Vanish, ye darking 
     Some of them scaling 
Unwisely frank, with hearts that spurned concealing, 
That with this wench 'twere very easy dealing. 
Have all one source, one mode of healing; 
These chants, to youth and all its sports appealing, 
Or oft, reluctant years its warrant sealing, 
My troubled heart to joy unsealing, 
With calm across my tumult stealing, 
The powers of Nature here, around my path, revealing? 
Now failing, now, perchance, success revealing,-- 
I scarce can stand, my knees are trembling! 
I find a box, the first resembling, 
The colors of hope to the valley cling, 
And to the mob laid bare each thought and feeling, 
You'll ne'er attain it, save you know the feeling, 
Ah, every utterance from the depths of feeling 
And Memory holds me now, with childish feeling, 
To lead the women, learn the special feeling! 
He seemed to have the sudden feeling 
And through thy frame the liquor's potence fling. 
     Others are sailing, 
     Fright us, weirdest links uncoiling 
     Through the sand and boulders toiling, 
     O that the darkling 
     Starlight is sparkling, 
On the threshold he stood, and _Margaret_! calling, 
The night is falling. 
Midst of Hell's howling and noises appalling, 
comrade crazy, rude, repelling: 
Serene in primal strength, compelling 
Thou'lt find, this drink thy blood compelling, 
From such a face as thine there is no telling. 
        He saw it plunging and filling, 
This fiddling, shouting, ten-pin rolling 
They rave, as Satan were their sports controlling. 
Sweet darling! 
A single scarlet band is gleaming, 
     In silk and velvet gleaming 
     Had a coat with ribbons streaming, 
That like a cataract, down rocks and gorges foaming, 
I am the fugitive, all houseless roaming, 
No broader than a knife-blade seeming! 
In scarlet coat, with golden trimming, 
A cloak in silken lustre swimming, 
I hear the distant drumming. 
Where I and Martha wait thy coming. 
MARTHA (_coming_) 
The bittern's changeless booming." 
And the garden, brightly blooming, 
Mere curiosity their spirits warming: 
Without a salary their parts performing. 
MARGARET (_attentively listening_) 
There was a king once reigning, 
     There was a king once reigning, 
Ah, if I leave this spot with fond designing, 
     And loved him past explaining, 
Where you, ye beasts? Founts of all Being, shining, 
And rise not, on us shining, 
A woman's form, in beauty shining! 
And must I find her body, there reclining, 
Ye flow, ye feed: and am I vainly pining? 
Shalt thou sponge through the term beginning! 
With what delight, what profit winning, 
It seems to me that with enchanted cunning 
I see him timidly, in doubt, around us running, 
Vile din! yet one must learn to bear the crooning. 
Which elsewhere I have just been earning. 
Thine obligation newly earning. 
A sweet, uncomprehended yearning 
And grasps me now a long-unwonted yearning 
Well, Margaret soon will still your yearning: 
Both flower and fruit the future years adorning? 
I soon shall lead him to a clearer morning. 
        As in the early morning 
A hundred fires along the ranks are burning. 
And while a thousand tears were burning, 
I thrill and tremble; tear on tear is burning, 
Ah, bravo! Do I find you burning? 
My song, to faint Aeolian murmurs turning, 
Be quick! I see her there, returning. 
over the spot where the victim fell, and lie in wait for the returning 
I hear the noise of instruments attuning,-- 
With fire on fire your throbbing forehead crowning, 
Only when meadow, field, and you are drowning. 
I know not what they are brewing and doing. 
I, too, was fair, and that was my undoing. 
     Cover, in going, 
As if with fettered feet that stay her going. 
Make merry when the dance is going! 
For this, all pleasure am I foregoing; 
As thou, up yonder, with running and leaping 
I much prefer the cheeks where ruddy blood is leaping, 
To no one hope of mine--not one--its promise keeping:-- 
     Within whose dread and holy keeping 
And never cared to have them in my keeping. 
So now I take thee into my keeping, 
And mother, in her notions of housekeeping, 
     Behind me, field and meadow sleeping, 
        Alone, and ah! unsleeping, 
And so, as bachelor, into his grave a-creeping, 
        I'm weeping, weeping, weeping, 
Upon the verge of bitter weeping, 
MARTHA (_weeping_) 
We have no maid: I do the knitting, sewing, sweeping, 
This round and round the world in freedom sweeping; 
     Trees on trees beside us trooping, 
     And the crags above us stooping, 
Not even a jewel, not a ring, 
     Like glass doth ring, 
        But with the wedding-ring! 
There was a Lion red, a wooer daring, 
A cavalier am I, like others in my bearing. 
So long the poor boy waits a hearing, 
swearing! 
See, here's the coat-of-arms that I am wearing! 
Which through the firmament diffused is faring, 
Upon its track to follow, follow soaring! 
In every quarter is preparing. 
By all love ever rejected! By hell-fire hot and unsparing! 
And both, tormented then by flame unsparing, 
Nor the desire for her sweet body bring 
My body's chill and shuddering,-- 
     In beauty bewildering, 
_which blazes out the chimney. The_ WITCH _comes careering 
I hear one's footsteps, hither steering. 
(_Whispering_) 
FAUST (_whispering_) 
FAUST (_entering_) 
Take children's, monkeys' gaze admiring, 
        We, his aspiring 
     Hark, the inspiring 
But ne'er from heart to heart you'll speak inspiring, 
        Weeping, desiring, 
     Sound of their quiring! 
MEPHISTOPHELES (_boring_) 
     Deploring 
It yonder hastes, new fields of life exploring; 
     The beauty perished beyond restoring. 
By the quickening glance of the gracious Spring; 
     How soon will't spring, 
The one almighty force enduring,-- 
Thine endless love, thy faith assuring, 
Here is a song, which, if you sometimes sing, 
ALL (_sing_) 
Filling the All with harmony unceasing! 
Yet, Lord, Thy messengers are praising 
     Dipping and rising 
Thou wouldst be devil enough to grudge my soul the blessing. 
Ah, those were the days of blessing! 
With wings that winnow blessing 
It is the greatest heavenly blessing, 
She slept, while we were caressing: 
To have a dear thing for one's caressing. 
(_She begins to sing while undressing_) 
From Heaven through Earth I see them pressing, 
        Beyond expressing, 
But, if thou hadst the power of guessing, 
        Ah, past guessing, 
And hast unlearned thy kissing? 
My friend, so short a time thou'rt missing, 
To classify them for your using. 
With what fierce blows upon my neck 'tis beating! 
One only fear still needs repeating: 
Take not unkindly its repeating: 
Sang, God's new Covenant repeating? 
Under the old ribs of the rock retreating, 
[Illustration: _Under the old ribs of the rock retreating_,] 
Much of his cousins did he speak, entreating 
A chance-dropped word may set me sweating! 
Thyself to Godhood haughtily inflating; 
You pass the night in dissipating:-- 
What time takes she for dissipating? 
All Heaven and Earth in rapture penetrating; 
And Life, alas! is fleeting. 
The art is long, the time is fleeting. 
Full many a place of meeting. 
Greet her? Not I: unless, when meeting, 
And oft, with zeal my critic-duties meeting, 
To smash her windows be a greeting! 
Your husband's dead, and sends a greeting. 
That we should give to each his kindly greeting. 
Thy life disquieting 
The foreign people are a-fighting. 
While we to warm our paws are waiting. 
Beckons afar, the race awaiting; 
Who makes Olympus sure, the Gods uniting? 
Who braids the noteless leaves to crowns, requiting 
Systems to words 'tis easy suiting; 
The crowd for strongest drink is panting, 
Full well you know what here is wanting; 
Who'll help me to my footing? 
In star and fire light shooting, 
Mists rise,--red, angry rays are darting 
        With anguish smarting, 
A travelling scholar, then? The _casus_ is diverting. 
A stubborn bachelor there's no converting. 
And I should turn to better ways than flirting. 
With even devils consorting. 
All instruments are fitting; 
Must use the tools that best are fitting. 
They've danced already more than fitting. 
May honor as is fitting. 
The cither's smashed! For nothing more 'tis fitting. 
To my impertinence befitting, 
As in the mouths of puppets are befitting! 
With maxims most pragmatical and hitting, 
With sharpest nippers flitting, 
There's yet a skull I must be splitting! 
Reflect, soft wood is given to you for splitting, 
Those two, the old one with the young one sitting, 
And, like a bankrupt debtor sitting, 
As the Cathedral thou wert quitting? 
     CHORUS (_shouting_) 
     CHORUS (_shouting_) 
With words 'tis excellent disputing; 
        For us be suing,-- 
I see the plan thou art pursuing: 
     His thirst in puddles laving; 
     But nothing cured his raving. 
No word can ever lose a jot from thieving. 
The villain! From his children thieving! 
On words 'tis excellent believing; 
Day's Eden-brightness still relieving 
Though some familiar tone, retrieving 
And sweet, clear echoes came, deceiving 
And swift, and swift beyond conceiving, 
She could not think, herself, of giving 
Thousands were done to death from poison of my giving; 
And a bad conscience sharper misery giving! 
Before folks, lest there be misgiving: 
My friend, thou soon shalt lose all such misgiving: 
And I must hear, by all the living, 
My future sweetheart, just as he were living. 
Be thou but self-possessed, thou hast the art of living! 
Could not prevent his shameful way of living! 
The poor wee thing its natural living; 
It is so wretched, forced to beg my living, 
How Cupid stirs and leaps, on light and restless wing. 
     Hear them snoring, hear them blowing! 
  A weaving, flowing 
     O'er the stones, the grasses, flowing 
No dagger's here, that set not blood to flowing; 
Shalt not, in lace and ribbons flowing, 
The silver brook to golden rivers flowing. 
I view, through all my senses swiftly flowing! 
     Garments, out-flowing, 
The silent world beneath me glowing, 
Poured speedy death, in poison glowing: 
     They, with their glowing 
In every vein and fibre newly glowing. 
  Life, all-glowing, 
She falters on, her way scarce knowing, 
I do not pretend to aught worth knowing, 
     And the rocky snouts, outgrowing,-- 
Here could I spend whole hours, delaying: 
Why! If the fount of wine should still be playing? 
          Their kirtles all were playing. 
Here Nature shaped, as if in sportive playing, 
          The fiddle-bow was playing. 
          And the fiddle-bow was playing. 
Useless talking, delaying and praying! 
            Himself with care arraying: 
          Waylaying and betraying! 
          And hips and elbows straying. 
          "Be decent while you're staying!" 
Forsooth, the eyes they are of one whom, dying, 
        To whom his mistress, dying, 
  I stood beside his bed of dying. 
        When came his time of dying, 
And what I lost, grows real and undying. 
     Sounds of hope, of love undying! 
Then bind me in thy bonds undying, 
            Who stood, the dance surveying: 
And found that heavier scores to his account were lying. 
That is the breast whereon I once was lying,-- 
In Padua buried, he is lying 
What I possess, I see far distant lying, 
     For the wanderer. Mice are flying, 
     Others are flying; 
Or snatch a rapid bliss in flying, 
Joy follows woe, woe after joy comes flying. 
When thus I hail the Moment flying: 
        Naught else to his heir denying 
Without return to be enjoying. 
Thou shouldst not find it so annoying, 
     Are they all awake and crying? 
Whether you everywhere be trying, 
There flames a desolation, blazing 
  (_Dance and Song_.) 
Whom but to see, puts out the fire of Song! 
That unrelieved, our whole life long, 
Ah, God! but Art is long, 
     The way is wide, the way is long: 
Day long, and half night long. 
Her time is miserably long; 
Yes, the mountain's side along, 
And in its whirlpool forces us along! 
That one, two, three! thereto belong. 
I hate,--these noises of the throng: 
Invoke not thus the well-known throng, 
The purer joys that round the Poet throng,-- 
Now, while the sky leads forth its starry throng, 
     See, what a wild and crazy throng! 
Like eating and drinking, free and strong,-- 
One first perceives the bass is deep and strong. 
It smiled, and tumbled, and grew strong. 
In head and breast there's something wrong. 
And danger thousand-fold, our race to wrong. 
Give us a song! 
Lulled in my lap with many a song, 
When the vault echoes to the song, 
Sweeps an infuriate glamouring song! 
(_in alternating song_) 
Such is the everlasting song 
A nasty song! Fie! a political song-- 
I'll sing her, first, a moral song, 
"Were I a little bird!" so runs her song, 
And call it mirth, and call it song!

And I am yet so young, so young! 
Dear me, how fine! So handsome, and so young! 
Ah!

     And Reason then resumes her speech: 
My own disgust is strengthened by your speech: 
Through spirit-power and spirit-speech, 
is burning. Various figures appear in the vapors which 
FAUST (_dancing with the young witch_) 
A man can think and know so much? 
Dear God! However is it, such 
And all the caps are lifted high; 
And blessed myself, and boasted high,-- 
     Suns are on high. 
I have myself inflated all too high; 
Behind her chair, was listening nigh. 
Custom, or not! It happens, though. 
And you look as though 
Have you not led this life quite long enough? 
And mix things madly through and through, 
That runs, quicksilver-like, one's fingers through,-- 
     Sylph! 
Good! if I have the choice, so let the wine be Rhenish! 
Our Fatherland can best the sparkling cup replenish. 
My mind its fairest work to finish! 
With wilful cavil would diminish, 
Within a narrow sphere to flourish; 
With unmixed food thy body nourish; 
I offer it, and humbly wish 
The end of that far-spreading death 
     Who put me to death; 
My mother have I put to death; 
Demeans me to myself, and with a breath, 
When, after dancing out your breath, 
When from the hard-won goal the wreath 
One sees that in nothing no interest he hath: 
     Who eaten me hath! 
As if stood before you, gray and loath, 
Seeketh a path 
With terrible wrath 
And half in wrath: 
The bloody laurels on the brow he bindeth! 
In clasping maiden-arms he findeth! 
     Gems, as it boundeth 
     And spreading, surroundeth 
Come! come! The night already vanisheth. 
But, much as my heart to see thee yearneth, 
        Why it trembleth, why it yearneth, 
        Why this anxious heart so burneth, 
The secret horror of him returneth; 
Now like a tender thread it creepeth, 
Here steam, there rolling vapor sweepeth; 
His spirit's ferment far aspireth; 
And all the Near and Far that he desireth 
The fairest stars from Heaven he requireth, 
He will brighten the world with the tints he loveth, 
Everywhere form in development moveth; 
Here, rich in hope and firm in faith, 
Tis Lilith. 
God help us! that is done with: 
We've but naked soles to run with. 
What use, in having that to play with? 
How many have I made away with! 
Physics and Metaphysics both! 
Hear, therefore, one alone, for that is best, in sooth, 
The Devil needs a rat's quick tooth. 
Lies not beneath us, firm, the earth? 
In misery! In despair! Long wretchedly astray on the face of the earth,

On summer holidays to seek 
The special faculty you seek. 
Among this crowd of merry folk, 
That, as the drops below its brink, 
Here is a phial: in her drink 
So many days of life you drink! 
And deepest sleep will on her senses sink. 
And from the worn and fingered book 
(_begins to declaim, with much emphasis, from the book_) 
That naught is said but what is in the book: 
(_He writes, and returns the book_.) 
From page to page, from book to book! 
So you can better watch, and look 
One soon fatigues, on woods and fields to look, 
O tremble not! but let this look, 
Up by the brook, 
On the door-bench, in the passage dark, 
     Drizzle, whistling through the dark. 
You are the master of the house, I mark, 
The length of the time they'd never mark. 
Or I'll blow out his being's flickering spark! 
     The magic notes, like spark on spark, 
I tell you, give but more--more, ever more, they ask: 
To satisfy them is a task.-- 
But then, alas! they've read an awful deal. 
I will confess, I knew not what appeal 
The hallowed Original 
You now oppose the fist infernal, 
Trust one of us, this Whole supernal 
And call this ardor, so supernal, 
_He_ dwells in splendor single and eternal, 
Endless, eternal and eternal,-- 
In yielding, that must be eternal! 
So, to the actively eternal 
And towards a self-erected goal 
     There gathers the crowd for carnival: 
Yet here a huge embarrassment I feel: 
     As 'twere five hundred hogs, we feel 
But I was angry with myself, to feel 
And move, as we deliberately impel, 
If one is prim and good, as ancient rules compel: 
For now, thy vapors to dispel, 
To don the self-same gay apparel, 
A long, sharp sword for show or quarrel,-- 
To gnaw it where, with just a morsel 
The fact is easy to unravel, 
Their air's so odd, they've just returned from travel: 
Man's active nature, flagging, seeks too soon the level; 
They're mountebanks, upon a revel.

Ah, dearest dame, let not your courage fail! 
     Ten thousand times my sweetheart hail!_ 
     A rag will answer for a sail; 
     To cheer the witch will salve avail; 
That scarcely more is left me to fulfil. 
At Padua rest, in consecrated soil. 
Ah, that no wing can lift me from the soil, 
_Sancta simplicitas_! no need of such a toil; 
The glow retreats, done is the day of toil; 
And yet, beyond a cavil, 
presence! Imprisoned! In irretrievable misery! Delivered up to evil 
So humanly to gossip with the Devil! 
Would e'er these people scent the Devil! 
Who works, excites, and must create, as Devil. 
Also be a devil. 
Assume the part of wizard or of devil? 
And have a care to be most civil: 
tail set wagging: canine habits, all! 
As they are seen by each and all. 
Spirit sublime, thou gav'st me, gav'st me all 
I speed along, completest man of all, 
And cursed be Patience most of all! 
Point your fingers and nip them all! 
     Before us go the women all. 
Feeling is all in all: 
     Sir Urian sits over all. 
With honest purpose, once for all, 
Had I but seven hours for all, 
        And bitterness all. 
My spirit cannot practise it at all. 
Thy fancy's rickets plague thee not at all: 
The narrow being suits me not at all. 
Is nothing but the spirit of you all, 
But, let us go! 'Tis gray and dusky all: 
     The world's the ball: 
Why does he come, then, to our ball? 
Then cease to bore us at our ball! 
Walked thyself off this earthly ball 
I should not on the Devil call, 
What you the Spirit of the Ages call 
Then to thine aid the witch must call. 
     Doth rise and fall, 
The air is cold, the vapors fall. 
The highest favor Love lets fall! 
O, everywhere on him you fall! 
Every flea may it so befall! 
        The world is gall 
Before the joys of life shall pall.

From Heaven, across the World, to Hell! 
Betake thee to Hell!

Why so fast and so fell? 
The young Queen in her crystal shell, 
Themselves, their holy value, and their spell! 
Why, here in dust, entice me with your spell, 
Pines, lest she hold as lost the man she loves so well! 
I hope we'll suit each other well; 
Then why not I, in mine, as well? 
If there he's led, they think, he'll follow them as well. 
Tis well. 
And none demanded: who got well? 
Peal rather there, where tender natures dwell. 
Farewell! 
Farewell! 
 Ladies, farewell! 
My mother would--farewell!

I feel his presence like something ill. 
Who has done me this ill?

Fly-snout and mosquito-bill, 
Fly-snout and mosquito-bill,-- 
A fine way, this, thy time to fill! 
Learn of the great and little world your fill, 
Now draw the stoppers, and drink your fill! 
So, take of traps and scenes your fill, 
The other, then, its place may fill. 
Come, let us mount this little hill; 
Ah, woe! thy lips are chill, 
Could I thy withered body kill, 
And on her neighbor try thy skill! 
     The lofty skill 
As he does in his dull old mill, 
But have a care that you nothing spill! 
Frog in green, and cricket-trill. 
Frog in grass, and cricket-trill,-- 
Frog in grass and cricket-trill, 
Summons thee hither to the door-sill, 
     Of Science, still 
Black as it seemed, I blackened still, 
And still. 
Thou pimp most infamous, be still! 
Yet we're eternally sterile still. 
'Tis struggling still! 
Sits unrestful still, 
Thou crav'st the same illusion still! 
The Doctor's in thy body still. 
Nay, but I will! 
Restrain thyself, thy sense and will 
Just as God will! 
Each tries his hand at what he will; 
Recall thy wandering will! 
And knows not what she should, or will; 
Let happen all that can or will! 
O beautiful fountain, that flows at will! 
We've washed, and are bright as ever you will, 
I know not what compels me to thy will: 
I've else, for all, a kindly will, 
And blacker yet was in my will; 
Fix and arrange it to my will; 
He'd show, at any rate, good-will,-- 
The cloth upon thy board bids smoothly thee unroll, 
In the pool! 
If her whims the wife control, 
As if you'd use, to get control, 
Which leads thee with its motherly control, 
That seemed to be a chain of pearl.

To leave my wife, my trade, in manner so ungrateful!

Their clothes are colors that softly gleam. 
Give me thy hand! 'Tis not a dream! 
The last full wherry takes the stream. 
First children, and then work for bread to feed 'em,-- 
And little wings--we know 'em! 
How little now I deem, 
Thee, too!--'Tis thou! It scarcely true doth seem-- 
Now like contempt the crowd's applauses seem: 
So here she guessed, from every gem, 
And trees that daily with new leafage clothe them! 
From happy hours, and left me to deplore them. 
And names the Good, whose cheating fortune tore them 
And if no headache persecute them,

But tell me, pray, the proper means to gain them. 
I'll hang thereon with joy, and freely drain them; 
But, ah! in the streets I dare not bear them, 
Nor in the church be seen to wear them. 
I honor them. 
The bagpipe here unites them. 
To maim and slay delights them: 
With little wit, and ease to suit them,

Yet, for the threshold's magic which controlled him,

          Balm, we arrayed him; 
          We tenderly laid him: 
With fairest images of dreams infold him, 
Not yet art thou the man, to catch the Fiend and hold him!--

     I'd know him and shame him. 
     And darest not name him? 
MARGARET (_throwing herself before him_) 
Fate such a bold, untrammelled spirit gave him, 
The dream of drink shall mock, but never lave him: 
Dragged through the wildest life, will I enslave him, 
Whose over-hasty impulse drave him 
With struggling, chilling, checking, so deprave him 
     Arches above him! 
        Praising and pleading him, 
        Brotherly feeding him, 
        Lovingly needing him,

To wind the world in unison with him? 
     Let it not fail him; 
     If your aid avail him, 
And willingly a glass I'll fill him. 
As well thou know'st, within an hour 'twill kill him. 
(_She turns away from him_.) 
What will you bet? There's still a chance to gain him, 
Gently upon _my_ road to train him! 
MARGARET (_turning to him_) 
And many draughts are known to him. 
        Ah, dared I clasp him, 
Come a hundred after him,

God knows I loved, and can't forget him! 
And, truly, I did naught to fret him: 
Life somewhat better might content him,

Thou wilt unloose my chain,

That's no great luck for me, 'tis plain. 
Did I not fear the landlord might complain,

Not yet, it seems, have I given him pain. 
My brother! This is Hell's own pain! 
Further and satisfy your pain,

I take the wildering whirl, enjoyment's keenest pain,

No fount of newer strength is in my brain: 
Woman, from such a name refrain! 
There's an old story has the same refrain; 
And all strike in at each refrain! 
I tell thee, from thy tears refrain! 
Thou shalt abstain--renounce--refrain! 
First Love returns, with Friendship in his train. 
I would I had a more cheerful strain! 
So that it be a bran-new strain! 
Take heed! 'Tis of the latest cut, my strain, 
But other aspects now obtain: 
You've made me roundly sweat, that's certain! 
The girls have much desire to ascertain 
        Help! rescue me from death and stain! 
Yes, of the kind which men attain! 
Of human thought and knowledge mine, in vain; 
For which I prayed. Not unto me in vain 
Whose wicked clench is all in vain! 
Are over--'tis all in vain! 
And snares the soul with visions vain; 
Then how shall we begin? 
We're here together, so begin! 
Queer Son of Chaos, to begin! 
Then pluck up heart, and give us sterling coin! 
Sense, Reason, Sentiment, and Passion join,-- 
All unprepared, the charm I spin: 
And now Death comes, and ruin! 
felon-comrade, who feeds on mischief and gluts himself with ruin? 
Thou canst not compass general ruin, 
        Calling to ruin. 
her increasing wretchedness, and suffered her to go helplessly to ruin! 
On! on! 
'Twas kissing and coddling, on and on! 
The flame they follow, on and on, 
My thoughts from torment, led me on, 
'Tis I! Come on! 
What's going on? 
I'll not forget while the world rolls on! 
And secretly the jewels don, 
Commend your soul to God for pardon, 
     They lured me so, I climbed thereon. 
There's blood thereon. 
That's not enough: we must believe thereon. 
And mother gave a loan thereon? 
     A tough old sow and the mother thereon, 
We'll have our private joy thereon. 
Would pain me in its wonted fashion. 
Let every marvel take form and fashion 
How changed in fashion 
Where Love and Friendship still divinely fashion 
Counsel in shrewd old-fashion! 
To find an opportune occasion. 
Scarce through a glass, by rare occasion, 
But win her by my own persuasion. 
How shall one lead it by persuasion? 
See I with precision? 
Midst of the wrathful, infernal derision, 
I knew the sweet sound of the voice of the vision! 
Of joyous days ye bring the blissful vision; 
My bosom burns with that sweet vision; 
Meets, to-night, my vision! 
In all the fullness of my vision 
With new impulsion 
My senses heave in this convulsion! 
For just where fails the comprehension, 
Of these one covets some slight apprehension. 
Of course! But only shun too over-sharp a tension, 
Hear them, to deeds and passion 
To quench the fervors of glowing passion! 
Too old am I to play with passion; 
The bonds that bless, the wreaths that crown his passion! 
Thy passion! 
She, there? She's coming from confession, 
'Tis long since thou hast been to mass or to confession. 
Waste not a day in vain digression: 
To walk with many a sweet digression,-- 
Why, therefore, yield to such depression? 
Seize every possible impression, 
Cursed be the lying dream's impression 
To play,--with grace and bold expression, 
Hear, of that girl I'd have possession! 
Desiring no possession 
And make it firmly your possession; 
Cursed, all that flatters as possession, 
The art bequeathed to his possession! 
One must, at least, make this admission-- 
He gave you, further, no commission? 
They seek the Evil One in wild confusion: 
     Where, in seclusion, 
But this is not of swift conclusion; 
     Lost in illusion. 
Leave to withdraw from my intrusion. 
Therein I've borne so much probation! 
Agreed! But 'tis a short probation. 
Here am I!--what mean perturbation 
If Poetry be your vocation, 
I use no lengthened invocation: 
About my bet I feel no trepidation. 
On insecure foundation. 
That ghosts can't stand on ordinary foundation? 
His path predestined through Creation 
Who, then, the changeless orders of creation 
Then range with all my senses through creation, 
Long is the calm brain active in creation; 
Sucks melancholy food from your creation; 
Of the qualities of his creation,-- 
A little freedom and recreation. 
With arts of mine afford thee recreation. 
As did a certain snake, my near relation. 
We pine and thirst for Revelation, 
Of youth collect, to hear the revelation! 
Have lent, in need and tribulation. 
The sun-orb sings, in emulation, 
Pardon, I heard your declamation; 
Now, give me of your taste some intimation. 
Who brings the One to join the general ordination, 
Give the rein to his imagination, 
Yet, truly, I've some inclination 
To leave them is my inclination. 
Aha! you lick your chops, from sheer anticipation. 
Come, walk at once! A rapid occupation 
In such an art I crave some preparation, 
Here rustles one that soon will work my liberation. 
Thou'rt shown to all the younger generation: 
Receive the people's honest veneration! 
You'll find it of peculiar operation. 
And dash out my brains in desperation! 
To view me is thine aspiration, 
A good man, through obscurest aspiration, 
What need to talk of Inspiration? 
Craving the speech of inspiration, 
Securely works his inspiration. 
Must start the needful perspiration, 
Had you not, long since, demonstration 
Will make a brilliant demonstration.

Come, draw thy circle, speak thine adjuration, 
O Sibyl excellent, enough of adjuration! 
If you would whirl in regular gyration 
Come, let me know your expectation 
If I fulfill my expectation, 
Takes from the People's moods no irritation; 
Time, only, strengthens the fine fermentation. 
And he deserves thy kitchen's best potation: 
But hither bring us thy potation, 
Especially if you heard and heeded his hortation. 
And serve thee in a social station; 
How lucky he, whose gifts his station 
And now!--I could tear my hair with vexation. 
It gives me great vexation; 
As from a corpse that breeds infection. 
'Tis very hard to shun the false direction; 
They feel, themselves, their resurrection: 
So like the medicine, it baffles your detection. 
From thee, thou jade! and seek protection 
From the bonds of Work, from Trade's restriction; 
Propel the high poetic function, 
So, these fine forces, in conjunction, 
So long I make no prohibition. 
Cursed be, at once, the high ambition 
Much do I know--but to know all is my ambition. 
And, like an old and half-extinct tradition, 
I have a friend of high condition, 
There hoe and dig, as thy condition; 
Three hundred masses buy, to save him from perdition! 
Such dilettants!--perdition! 
Rat-catching piper, thou!--perdition! 
Most zealously I seek for erudition: 
I crave the highest erudition; 
Cursed be the glare of apparition 
My thanks! I find the dead no acquisition, 
And fain would make my acquisition 
Who'll also add his deposition. 
Renewed is Pain: with mournful repetition 
My fairest luck finds no fruition: 
Who dares the child's true name in public mention? 
Hast thou, then, nothing more to mention? 
Com'st ever, thus, with ill intention? 
Would then no more impede my godlike motion; 
Give, unrestrained, the old emotion, 
I'd build a thousand bridges meanwhile, I've a notion. 
Canst thou thyself not brew the potion? 
The strength of Hate, Love's deep devotion,-- 
Has for ill-gotten goods the right digestion." 
The Church alone, beyond all question, 
Many enigmas there might find solution. 
It is a magic shape, a lifeless eidolon. 
And now, I do entreat this boon-- 
        Such is its boon! 
        Capitulate soon. 
We'll talk about the matter soon. 
Neighbor! your cordial! (_She falls in a swoon_.) 
Transform him again into his favorite likeness, that he may crawl upon 
'Tis thy mother's son! 
And we no less revere you for that reason: 
A red mouse from her mouth--sufficient reason. 
     So had I my reason. 
Who'd think of that in love's selected season? 
     Let me win in good season! 
We're only genuine children still, in Age's season! 
        Burst ye the prison, 
By such alone can we be won. 
The true witch-element we learn. 
The time I verily can discern 
O had I ne'er been born! 
Off! or you're lost ere morn. 
I burn! I burn! 
They shine, and spirt, and stink, and burn! 
When all the honest folk will turn 
Keep close! or we are parted, in our turn, 
Where would you get contemporary fun? 
And hast on smaller scale begun. 
Have you, perchance, elsewhere begun? 
        The coaxing shun 
Is't not soon enough when morning chime has run? 
The murderers, whither have they run? 
A dreary light, like that of dawn! 
The lip so red, the cheek's clear dawn, 
A faith bequeathed from Childhood's dawn, 
Perhaps 'twas brought by some one as a pawn, 
Let the thing be! All thence have evil drawn: 
No doubt you're right: no trace of mind, I own, 
And half and half thou art, I own. 
That were a charming sport, I own: 
        And hold, and own! 
Yet must be cared for, you will own. 
Ah, who may all this splendor own? 
Thou, monster, wilt nor see nor own 
And as for Faith and Church, I grant to each his own. 
Better the summit, I must own: 
Thee, boundless Nature, how make thee my own? 
With milk and water: 'twas my own.

If one some index could be shown, 
Patience must in the work be shown. 
What wouldst thou, then? She thinks that thou art flown; 
And see, that nothing can be known! 
And when a dozen thee have known, 
Medusa's tale to thee is known. 
Yes, for our household small has grown, 
But mother's sleep so light has grown, 
Still o'er my heart is that illusion thrown? 
Thou'rt also free to all the town. 
A house, a little garden near the town. 
No! 
A slave am I, whate'er I do-- 
O, no! As yet, it would not do. 
What's left undone to-day, To-morrow will not do. 
                  Good Sir, pray do! 
Thou goest away! O Henry, if I could go! 
Now, whither shall we go? 
To the lecture-hall you were forced to go,-- 
The door is open, art free to go. 
But I must go. 
Unto a neighbor she must go, 
And treasures, buried long ago: 
And thus the bitter task forego

_Fortissimo_. 
No further step--no, no!

My husband dead! Let me die, too! 
Take me, too! take me, too! 
I swear, with this condition, too, 
Yes, Neighbor! that's my notion, too: 
That, too! 
And this young lady will be present, too? 
In Nature and in Science too. 
Important matter, yet attractive too? 
Who overcometh, winneth too. 
But let us not, by such despondence, so 
The first was so, the second so, 
Why do ye stir the porridge so? 
Therefore the third and fourth are so; 
A rogue you are, and you were always so. 
All that is fine and good, to hear it so: 
The country's custom is not so. 
How so? 
  How so? 
                        How so? 
O no! my wish is great, my power is only so-so. 
Are you, perhaps, a virtuoso?

Yet--all that drove my heart thereto,

And all, belonging thereunto, 
If I mistake not, there are two. 
     In two! in two!

For zigzag courses we are wont to keep. 
With all its bays, in shining sleep! 
Which to the vaulted ceiling creep, 
Be kind enough to light us up the steep! 
You'll never mount the airy steep 
The crooked jump, the heavy skip, 
How each his legs in nimble trip 
From every precipice and thicket damp 
MARGARET (_with a lamp_) 
Away, thou pimp! 
     The stubble is yellow, and green the crop. 
     The witches ride to the Brocken's top, 
Swift from the North the spirit-fangs so sharp 
Then from the East they come, to dry and warp 
under foot! Not the first! O woe! woe which no human soul can grasp, 
Where is the breast, which from itself a world did bear, 
And she much love, much faith to him did bear, 
Yet this delusion in our hearts we bear: 
He takes thee for a lady, dear! 
        Kathrina dear, 
And all her crime was a delusion dear! 
Ah, God! another one so dear 
Enjoin upon him, as his head is dear, 
You've verily hit the truth! Leipzig to me is dear: 
          How many a one has fooled his dear, 
She'd take the Devil at his word, I fear. 
With such a servant danger comes, I fear. 
My head is nigh to split, I fear: 
I feel, I know not why, such fear!-- 
Thee, form of flame, shall I then fear? 
And waking, hear. 
It seems to me as if I hear 
That he the rattling chain, the rustling straw, can hear. 
The hearts and minds of all who hear. 
Of all things in the world! Just hear-- 
To most exactly measure, sew and shear, 
Speak thy conditions plain and clear! 
And, if we're light, we'll travel swift and clear: 
        In daybreak clear, 
She showed me mine, in crystal clear, 
Save from the soul it rises clear, 
They're of a noble house, that's very clear: 
I kept the baby's cradle near 
On! my shrinking but lingers Death more near. 
If I attempt to venture near, 
        Rapture creative near? 
        Save I have him near. 
For good things, oft, are not so near; 
        Thus is the Master near,-- 
Ye, Spirits, come--ye hover near-- 
The circle narrows: he is near! 
The morning twilight is near. 
She does not dream her lover listens near; 
If there be airy spirits near, 
From the marshes we appear, 
The circle of Creation will appear, 
Dim, as through gathering mist, her charms appear!-- 
And Dilettanti in the parts appear. 
A most fastidious person you appear. 
Haughty and discontented they appear. 
Yet with the flowing beard I wear, 
Thou, else, dost well the devil-nature wear: 
The form diviner beings wear! 
On highest holidays might wear! 
But first, at least this half a year, 
I'd mourn him decently a year, 
Believe me, who for many a thousand year 
A gallant youth! has travelled far: 
My love was near, but now he's far; 
Thou art, and thou remain'st, a sophist, liar. 
stove, in the costume of a Travelling Scholar_.) 
With open throat sing chorus, drink and roar! 
Cursed be the vine's transcendent nectar,-- 
The touching of her lips, before the altar. 
She beckons, she nods not, her heavy head falls o'er; 
     Ah, when, within our narrow chamber 
        Within my lonely chamber 
     Flames in the breast each faded ember, 
Beasts, birds, trees, rocks, and all such lumber, 
The lovely land of wine, and song, and slumber. 
Have sung him truly into slumber: 
If you desire, a number. 
Squander the stars in any number, 
He sleeps! Enough, ye fays! your airy number 
To rate with gibes a scolder; 
I hope to see you moulder. 
     Salamander! 
Along this labyrinth of vales to wander, 
I must confess that forth I may not wander, 
You'll have him, when and where you wander: 
Yet thou canst often this way wander, 
How would I for the fault atonement render! 
For love, my blood and life would I surrender, 
Prone at her feet, relaxed and tender! 
I rub my hands, in expectation tender-- 
Leave that, my child! Thou know'st my love is tender; 
Her thoughts and yearnings seek thee, tenderer, fonder,-- 
                 He seems of her still fonder. 
I'll hear no more: 'tis vain to ponder 
Or, in the spheres we dream of yonder, 
Walk up and down an hour, before the mirror yonder,-- 
The window's here, the door is yonder; 
We'll surely find him by those poplars yonder. 
Then climb the rocky ramparts yonder, 
Out yonder? 
                 Flown up the alley yonder, 
Enough of that! Thy love sits lonely yonder, 
The threshold under, 
Hell heaves in thunder! 
The tree-trunks terribly thunder, 
The roots are twisting asunder! 
How roars the orgy louder! 
But only two wear powder. 
The finest lasses and the best of beer, 
Come up to Burgdorf? There you'll find good cheer, 
     And the new songs of cheer 
The beverage may work the proper cheer. 
At home I've neither rest nor cheer, 
Yet drinks their wines with hearty cheer. 
I seek him everywhere, I pry and peer, 
     Into the depths of Nature peer,-- 
Yes, I am Faust: I am thy peer! 
     Bid the new career 
I gratulate thee on thy new career! 
The bet I offer. 
The pure, their hands to offer, 
You well deserve a speedy marriage-offer: 
Surely for his soul's sake full many a prayer I'll proffer. 
Contentment flows from out my breast no longer. 
But ah! I feel, though will thereto be stronger, 
Thou hast therewith so filled and drowned her, 
So that by wish and will you bend her; 
First came thy passion's flood and poured around her 
What! I delay to free her? 
I dread, once again to see her? 
Poor Margaret flatter, and ensnare her, 
I'll yet detect thy sweetheart and ensnare her, 
Her life, in fact, they're loath to spare her. 
And the man berate her, 
Take me thither, I say, and liberate her! 
Thou'lt hear much more before we leave her. 
Grateful for gifts the Holy Christmas gave her, 
She took all the presents the fellow gave her. 
Yes, sing away, sing on, and praise, and brag of her! 
MARTHA (_adorning her_) 
     The queen she got them upon her, 
MEPHISTOPHELES (_aside to her_) 
Some day, as bridegroom, home to bear her. 
And all thy soul's devotion swear her?

And shall I see--possess her? 
(MARGARET _comes in, conceals herself behind the door, puts her 
Presents at once? That's good: he's certain to get at her! 
The surer, afterwards, to cheat her. 
Should his good-night in lustful gallop bleat her! 
Where four roads cross, in wanton play to meet her: 
A secret dread began to haunt her. 
Thou fool, go in and comfort her! 
And if we were discovered by her, 
I've often heard it said, a preacher 
I do not pretend I could be a teacher 
Might learn, with a comedian for a teacher. 
'Tis enough: ascend no higher,-- 
        Thou seest the Father; 
Dost recognize no more the tall cock's-feather? 
But see, what motley flames among the heather! 
     Through the moss and through the heather! 
Must tell my name, old face of leather? 
     Loveliest weather, 
Hung here, around this throne, where sat the father! 
A nice estate was left us by my father, 
The shadows thus within my bosom gather. 
Departed joy and pain wert wont to gather! 
        Thy sad sighs gather, 
     And in wildering escort gather! 
Well, we'll consider: thou canst gather 
I'm like a sentimental tom-cat, rather, 
We, more than others, might take comfort, rather: 
Some other labor seek thou rather, 
     Born of blue ether, 
     Vanish in flaming ether, 
There is a lively club together: 
How does it hold together_? 
When _There_ again we come together, 
There's both together! 
Yet, though I thresh them all together, 
That binds the Noble and Mean together. 
Where boon companions meet together, 
Unseen the threads are knit together. 
Just as we meant to hold them fast together. 
     Flow foamingly together, 
Let him find for thee the secret tether 
_Here_, an unwearied slave, I'll wear thy tether,

We also were not stupid, either, 
I cannot call them liars, either. 
Depose, with knowledge or without it, either! 
Before all else, I bring thee hither

That cross me, drawing hither and thither 
Where fly the shuttles hither and thither. 
Can we go thither?

'Twould go to the priest, as did the other. 
O, never seek to know the other!

You mustn't tell it to your mother! 
The best place give to my mother, 
This is a fair, as never was another! 
     Whom fat and butter made smoother: 
Let me not lose myself in all this pother! 
And each withdraws from, and repels, its brother. 
Then close at her side my brother, 
VALENTINE (_a soldier_, MARGARET'S _brother_) 
     Like that of Doctor Luther. 
That from the cradle to the bier 
My brother is a soldier, 
     Brightlier 
     Mightier 
A sarcasm on the asker. 
That, lessening side-wards, fainter grows and dimmer, 
Upward th'eternal lamp sends forth a glimmer, 
I am the go-between, and thou the wooer. 
Where ye for men twist shredded thought like paper, 
The Animals whimper_.) 
Of order and content around me whisper,-- 
The sand beneath thy feet makes whiter, crisper. 
Even now my powers are loftier, clearer; 
Yonder, with special light, there's something shining clearer 
Come on! we'll slip a little nearer. 
Thou, Spirit of the Earth, art nearer: 
murderer. 
     Freer and fairer. 
Yet is not grown a whit the fairer. 
For wilt thou not, no lover fairer, 
        There stood the old carouser, 
(_In a niche of the wall a shrine, with an image of the Mater 
     Light on the water! 
Thou'lt hear a masterpiece, no work completer: 
She juggles you as doctor now, that, after, 
A mind, once formed, is never suited after; 
(_She plucks a star-flower, and pulls off the leaves, one after

Pardon, this troop I cannot follow after 
OLD WOMAN (_to the Citizen's Daughter_) 
They still are moved at once to weeping or to laughter, 
I'll wait my proper time for laughter: 
O, nonsense! That's a thing for laughter; 
My pathos certainly would move Thy laughter, 
Though I were ne'er so far, it cannot falter: 
Old gentlemen, why at the outskirts? Enter! 
To swallow up each ranter, 
The mother saw them, and, instanter, 
Jump into hell instanter! 
Then through the safest gate you'll enter 
There is, to make thee young, a simpler mode and apter; 
And is a most eccentric chapter. 
Know'st thou, at last, thy Lord and Master? 
Lay thyself at the feet of the Master! 
Seest thou the spiral circles, narrowing faster, 
Mist-like melting, ever faster. 
Since he's installed, his arrogance grows faster. 
Why, for a poodle who has lost his master, 
He suits me not at all, our new-made Burgomaster! 
Thee and thy monkey-sprites with fell disaster? 
That, too, from thee? Murder and death of a world upon thee, monster! 
     Grapes that o'ercluster 
Error instead of Truth to scatter. 
Poison for such poor rats to scatter. 
They whirl and whistle, pull and chatter! 
If he can't every step bechatter, 
They crowd and push, they roar and clatter! 
     Islands, that flatter, 
I know how one the People's taste may flatter, 
When others dance, he weighs the matter: 
All ages have been taught the matter,-- 
How the dull fools enjoy the matter! 
What they're accustomed to, is no great matter, 
The fortune of this hour embitter! 
The green-embosomed houses glitter! 
I meant to say, were you not touched in earnest, ever? 
Here lieth one who loves thee ever, 
No sacrifice shall he repent of ever. 
And her head is wagging ever. 
She talks like one who raves in fever. 
  tongue be clever, 
If he had only been as clever, 
A face like thine beheld I never. 
Live with the like of him, may I never! 
Clasp you in bonds of love, relaxing never, 
One should allow one's self to jest with ladies never. 
And what one knows, one uses never. 
Thou dar'st not tell the youngsters--never! 
And spare my lungs henceforth: whoever 
Canst thou, poor Devil, give me whatsoever? 
Will serve thee at once and forever 
Fix in its place with thoughts that stand forever! 
The hope, from Error's deeps to rise forever! 
        Then fell his eyelids forever, 
Why plague thyself with threshing straw forever? 
The thraldom of thy woe to sever. 
Fear not that I this pact shall seek to sever? 
Well, well! That might have done, however, 
There must be such queer birds, however. 
And weak old Winter himself must shiver, 
I feel an icy shiver! 
I would myself unto the Devil deliver, 
Who would himself therefrom deliver? 
Released from ice are brook and river 
     Under and over, 
The days of that old Northern phantom now are over: 
     Follows them over. 
        His eyes with tears ran over, 
Float in thy twilight the meadows over, 
His prey to discover! 
Where canst thou horns and tail and claws discover? 
And yet, somehow, his face I can't discover. 
     Back and forth hover, 
     Hoo-hoo! Shoo-hoo! Nearer hover 
With spirits through mountain-caverns hover, 
blood, from thy hand, still lies upon the town! Avenging spirits hover 
     Pass as they hover; 
That was the voice of my lover! 
With several wild young blades, a soldier-lover: 
     Jay and screech-owl, and the plover,-- 
But come! we'll go from this fire to a newer: 
     Landscape and bower, 
     Bower on bower! 
The purest bliss was surely then thy dower. 
     Lo! in a shower 
Thine own ecstatic life on all things shower, 
daren't say how--to pluck the final flower! 
Then, at your play, behold the fairest flower 
I will convey thee there; and hear, what I can do! Have I all the power 
Who, headsman! unto thee such power 
And I? What drew me here with power? 
Each tender soul, with sentimental power, 
From these the angels draw their power, 
my power. 
To taste, I know not what, in haughty power, 
O would that I, before that spirit-power, 
She snuffs within her book of prayer, 
Crush me!--Air! 
Keen scent has she for tainted air; 
How raves the tempest through the air! 
     False word and form of air, 
One has at once another air. 
I only seize, with sketchy air, 
A will-o'-the-wisp in murky air. 
The tender bosom filled and fair, 
Alone and far, a girl most pale and fair? 
Blest he, whose bosom Truth makes pure and fair! 
Such things? Never beheld I aught so fair! 
"Ah, still delay--thou art so fair!" 
I'm neither lady, neither fair, 
By Heaven, the girl is wondrous fair! 
                   That is not fair! 
(_plaiting and binding up the braids of her hair_) 
The splendid sole adornment of her hair! 
How would the pearl-chain suit my hair? 
Eternal!--for the end would be despair. 
As is a devil in despair. 
The Prater shows no livelier stir, 
While Man's desires and aspirations stir,

Nor other labor, 
But spying all the doings of one's neighbor:

Rescue her, or woe to thee! The fearfullest curse be upon thee for 
That you have not the Roman realm to care for! 
I wish I knew something worse, that I might use it for 
And what shall be my counter-service therefor? 
So mean and shameless was her behavior, 
     And the lords and ladies of honor 
Another bite makes free the door: 
Thou canst! Just will it! Open stands the door. 
You've not the casks already at the door? 
And mother, nights, ne'er let us out the door 
Turn out who quarrels--out the door! 
(_with a bunch of keys and a lamp, before an iron door_) 
And we'll scatter chaff before her door! 
        Before thy lover's door? 
The boys shall dash her wreath on the floor, 
I am a creature young and poor: 
All, all! Alas, we poor!

And show that yours all other arts exceeds;

The strongest art within my hands!

     Blossoming forelands, 
     Boldly the highlands, 
When over crags and piny highlands 
And over plains and lakes and islands 
     Circling the islands; 
Why such a noise? What are my lord's commands? 
thou art calmly grinning at the fate of thousands! 
You have it now! he understands. 
Such a reproach not in the least offends; 
What he never comprehends, 
One at the window sits, with glass and friends, 
To Him above bow down, my friends, 
On gold depends 
And the Good and the Beautiful vilipends, 
Who teaches help, and succor sends! 
To gold still tends, 
A man who some result intends 
And blesses then, as home he wends 
How do you mean? Have you so many kinds? 
The choice is free: make up your minds. 
And when the storm in forests roars and grinds, 
Which brings me near and nearer to the Gods, 
Why should you rack, poor, foolish bards, 
One, when the play is out, goes home to cards; 
THE LORD THE HEAVENLY HOST _Afterwards_ 
The wilful summer-birds! 
Draw near, and view your patrons' faces! 
     Trees and rocks with grinning faces, 
Reel off a host of threads before their faces, 
They turn their faces, 
What dreams are yours in high poetic places? 
     See them swiftly changing places, 
     Down the high places, 
All times I'll have to think on you, all places! 
The same thing, in all places, 
But you have friends in other places, 
Are anything but pleasant places. 
He walks with haughty paces: 
I find these walls, these vaulted spaces 
     With crystalline spaces, 
Into the high ancestral spaces. 
     In the vast, the desert spaces! 
     And the winged races 
And clinging lust the world in its embraces; 
     In happy embraces, 
By sheer diffuseness you have won their graces, 
That meekness, lowliness, the highest graces 
"He scents the Jesuits' traces." 
The botching work each fine pretender traces 
When thou hast dashed this world to pieces, 
More speech than any tongue suffices 
No earthly meat or drink the fool suffices: 
And, when it finds an angle-worm, rejoices! 
I've had, myself, at times, some odd caprices, 
But mind, allow the tailor no caprices: 
Yet now I curse whate'er entices 
I craved, to censure others' vices. 
Forsooth! He serves you after strange devices: 
With dazzling cheats and dear devices 
But not at the dances! 
Whom, after rapid, maddening dances, 
You press and count the pulse's dances, 
The meteor that a moment dances,-- 
Woe for my garland! The chances 
Then, worthy Sir, improve betimes your chances! 
Could he but try the lottery's chances! 
How would the ape be sure his luck enhances. 
And then, with burning sidelong glances, 
Beckons my neighbor with her wanton glances, 
Let us, then, use a Jack-o'-lantern's glances: 
O fortunate, for whom, when victory glances, 
And lights so dimly, that, as one advances, 
I dread to see how such a fate advances. 
Get thee away with thine offences, 
(_He opens a volume, and commences_.) 
Her simple, homely life commences, 
My friend, thou'lt win, past all pretences, 
It dwarfed and withered all my soul's pretences! 
He cannot change external forces. 
And when from these my life itself divorces, 
Can deeply stir the inner sources; 
Here, on this earth, my pleasures have their sources; 
Why, tell me now, thou Son of Hades, 
Itself detaches, spreads and fades. 
All movement of my life impedes? 
Wherewith the mind itself deludes! 
That on the finer sense intrudes!

He is a man of manifold degrees, 
Misfortune tames him by degrees; 
His own most natural form he sees. 
That's better, now! The How and Where, one sees. 
And power not sees,-- 
thousands of ages! 
And over the wreck-strewn gorges 
The tempest whistles and surges! 
        Within my bosom aches! 
     Here, measure the lad for breeches. 
Come, Brother! we must see them to the benches. 
Deuce! how they step, the buxom wenches!

Why must the stream so soon run dry and fail us, 
And burning thirst again assail us? 
And such a luck from Heaven befell us, 
Yet something is required from us. 
Use well your time! It flies so swiftly from us;

For since we two together met, 
This miracle alone can work the Poet 
Go, league thyself with a poet, 
Margaret! 
Margaret! Margaret! 
HOW otherwise was it, Margaret, 
And Margaret? 
Tell no one thou has been with Margaret! 
The trinkets left for Margaret! 
Still weaving its eternal secret, 
An offal-barrel and a lumber-garret, 
        For thee these flowers I set. 
That which to Naught is in resistance set,-- 
Where God His human creature set, 
For you no bound, no term is set. 
A knave sharp-set! 
        He sat at the royal banquet 
        Alas! my tears did wet, 
Thy dear, dear hand!--But, ah, 'tis wet! 
And bones of beasts surround me yet! 
Just wait awhile: I'll have him yet. 
The Something of this clumsy world,--has yet, 
Why, wipe it off! Methinks that yet 
'Tis too early yet. 
Live with the ox as ox, and think it not a theft 
     Woman in thousand steps is theft. 
That, trust me, is the best mode left, 
Yet he who grasps the Moment's gift, 
But do church-penance in her sinner's shift! 
So now her head no more she'll lift, 
In vain that through the realms of science you may drift; 
Air? Light? 
Part of the Darkness which brought forth the Light, 
Fire, water, darkness, Day and Night! 
And _you_ he dowers with Day and Night. 
Part of the Part am I, once All, in primal Night,-- 
'Tis true, she showed me, on Saint Andrew's Night, 
Forerunning the grand Walpurgis-Night: 
We climb the Brocken's top in the Walpurgis-Night, 
     'Tis finished straight! 
Now, in the Devil's name, go straight, 
Address him, and he gambols straight; 
He lays for us the pillows straight! 
Spirit of Contradiction! On! I'll follow straight. 
     Make seven and eight, 
I am no hair's-breadth more in height, 
Turn thee about, and from this height 
They swear and storm, they yell and fight! 
I think the Devil must fight! 
I'm Magister--yea, Doctor--hight, 
Quick, bring a light! 
The more she seeks the day's broad light. 
Be sure to have thy luggage light. 
The Spirit aids me: now I see the light! 
Father had died before it saw the light, 
In motley pictures little light, 
All come forth to the cheerful light. 
     The better soul awakes to light. 
She is in secret brought to light, 
The moon conceals her light-- 
                 Why not? 'tis light. 
Use both the great and lesser heavenly light,-- 
     Then lower, and on the ground alight; 
And if that image of delight 
But more on him who gave her such delight. 
And one keeps watch then with delight. 
I would have shared your watches with delight, 
(_plucking the last leaf, she cries with frank delight_:) 
Is made but for a God's delight! 
But only, on so bold a flight, 
          Then round the circle went their flight, 
     When round the summit whirls our flight, 
That round and round some fiend misleads to evil plight, 
Thy business thus to slight: 
The loss of thee were truly very slight,-- 
Now am I wholly in thy might. 
     I leave in deep, prophetic night, 
Thinks on the jewels, day and night, 
My work and worry, day and night? 
One has one's hands full all the day and night; 
From the churches' solemn and reverend night, 
I pray you, Friend, 'tis now the dead of night; 
And then they draw the veil of night 
I blissed it all this livelong night; 
His palace for this festal night? 
     Or scratch them, day or night: 
     Who cannot raise himself to-night 
Rest not within mine arms to-night, 
And the heaviest weight to-night 
Well, well,--to-night--? 
And yet I'm right! 
          They danced to left, they danced to right: 
And straight or cross-wise, wrong or right, 
If what one does, or leaves undone, is right, 
I claim, I tell thee, all my right; 
'Tis planned most wisely, if I judge aright: 
Your mind will shortly be set aright, 
Why, be one then, outright! 
And now they say I killed the child outright. 
'Tis lucky thou hast seen the sight; 
But _us_ he thrusts in darkness, out of sight, 
But now, leave jesting out of sight! 
The uglier she is to sight, 
Come, Agatha! I shun the witch's sight 
Back on the town direct thy sight. 
And, worst of all, full many a wight 
     Is evermore a ruined wight. 
I say to thee, a speculative wight 
     Some one, within, is caught! 
As in Italian tales 'tis taught. 
If by the Spirit I am truly taught. 
Then thus: "In the Beginning was the _Thought_" 
'Twill plod along the path of thought, 
And temper the austere delight of thought. 
     Who takes no thought, 
And knead and shape her to your thought, 
We mark how, ere our times, a sage has thought, 
Where tends thy thought? 
And then, how far his work, and grandly, we have brought. 
And thus, to graver paces brought, 
     To him 'tis brought, 
Ah, thought I, in my conduct has he read it-- 
     Yet,-----as 'twas, I fancied it. 
        I never shall find it, 
        I never shall find it, 
        I never shall find it, 
With the police 'twere easy to compound it, 
But here the penal court will sift and sound it. 
Observe the time, and make it! 
And yet the Devil cannot make it. 
Is rare and strange, howe'er you take it: 
Dolorosa. Pots of flowers before it_.) 
If 'twould, my love, would I advise it? 
If thine, or whose? 'tis needless to debate it. 
And otherwise must I translate it. 
The _Word?_--impossible so high to rate it; 
We shall be made to dearly rue it. 
Who bade them so construe it? 
Save it! Save it! 
A hash, a stew, will bring success, believe it! 
Your hearers pick and pluck, as soon as they receive it! 
I have no name to give it! 
If you've a piece, why, just in pieces give it: 
My well-apportioned share of it." 
Your cane, if in the stream you fling it. 
If something's lost, he'll quickly bring it,-- 
(_He runs to the_ SHE-APE, _and lets her look through it_.) 
One carries home and then goes through it. 
now approaching and now retreating from it_) 
I have a mind to open it. 
I'll find her room to-day, and take you in it. 
I would force myself on thee and constrain it, 
But no more, no more can I attain it! 
Say, how? Say, where? If buried, did he own it? 
Who knows, now, whither the four winds have blown it? 
I know not, should I do it? 
No need to tell me twice to do it! 
They sing songs about me! 'tis bad of the folk to do it! 
Kiss me!--canst no longer do it? 
So, oftentimes, you miserably mar it! 
dungeon as a criminal, and given up to fearful torments! To this has it 
It will not harm her, when one tries it? 
That's well, indeed! For painful is it 
What work I do,--how hard and steady is it! 
And I must nurse it, warm beside me press it, 
My bed at night: if 't even stirred, I'd guess it, 
Don't incommode yourself! How could you ever kiss it! 
Is open left--the lines don't fit it. 
Well,--Chance, this time, has fairly hit it! 
No, greet my sweetheart not! I tell you, I'll resent it. 
My sweetheart greet and kiss! I dare you to prevent it! 
Then wear the crown, and show it, 
And all you find, be sure to show it! 
On men so various: now, my friend, pray show it. 
Yet will I know it. 
Upon our German stage, you know it, 
Before the Mother of God we'll lay it; 
With heavenly manna she'll repay it!" 
Demeans himself, and shames me by it; 
That you might win another by it. 
To take the spade in hand, and ply it. 
I swear, 'twill turn her head, to spy it: 
I am not used to that; I cannot stoop to try it-- 
        His lofty gait, 
Stand still, and you will see him wait; 
            May I not, then, upon you wait? 
A High and Low our souls await. 
        _Judex ergo cum sedebit, 
        Nil inultum remanebit_. 
        Quidquid latet, ad parebit, 
No one could ever speak to my discredit. 
Hath eaten many a land as forfeit, 
And never yet complained of surfeit: 
And here there hangs a key to fit: 
Then I received, as was most fit,

What dazzles, for the Moment spends its spirit: 
Couldst thou but read, within mine inmost spirit, 
        At the pane I sit; 
To bring no gift when her I visit. 
        The house I quit. 
The Garter does not deck my suit, 
I must, perforce, look up the matter. _[Exit_. 
[_Exit_.

Call it, then, what thou wilt,-- 
Ye choirs, have ye begun the sweet, consoling chant, 
Which, through the night of Death, the angels ministrant 
Yes, thou findest that unpleasant! 
     And roll incessant: 
     All for the distant 
Though our acquaintance is so recent, 
When thou, still innocent, 
Here gush the sparkles incandescent 
     And drop, quiescent? 
The words you've bandied are sufficient; 
In compliments you're both proficient, 
But for the gleam of heavenly light which Thou hast lent 
Destruction,--aught with Evil blent,-- 
A chain at first, then other ornament: 
Than here, in our New Testament. 
That is my proper element. 
Be quiet, friendly element! 
Whom wilt thou lure? God's-element! 
caldron to sound, and make a musical accompaniment. 
You'll know us, to your detriment. 
That even each joy's presentiment 
Demand'st thou, Pedant, too, a document? 
To the Devil, first, the instrument! 
Thus in desire I hasten to enjoyment, 
What bliss within this narrow den is pent! 
Serpent! Serpent! 
Help! Fire! Help! Hell-fire is sent! 
Which nowhere worthier is, more nobly sent, 
What use, a Whole compactly to present? 
Thou hast the moral right to cry me "shame!" at present. 
But, see! in all their height, at present, 
     I live at present! 
Might I, perhaps, depart at present? 
Hast never known a man, nor proved his word's intent? 
Of quiet, order, and content! 
If such your taste, and be content;

Save your own heart is eloquent! 
With grinning masks of life prevent 
Thy mother will not see, and stories we'll invent. 
'Tis easily displayed, and easy to invent. 
For, as regards this science, let me hint 
I lately gave therein a squint-- 
But away! [_Exeunt_. 
Be still, thou poodle; make not such racket and riot! 
Leave to the multitude their riot! 
Had he all love, all faith forgotten in his riot? 
     _My mother, the harlot, 
Folds and upholds he not 
He loves me--loves me not. 
Such a demand alarms me not: 
Saying: I believe Him not! 
He! he! suffer him not! 
     Stay without, follow him not! 
Thou angel, fear it not! 
     The fool knows it not! 
Then thou believest not! 
And you, Sir, travel always, do you not? 
Loves me--not--loves me--not-- 
But honored and at home is here the cloven foot. 
     Unto the knight with cloven foot! 
Yet I perceive no cloven foot; 
FAUST (_stamping his foot_) 
     He knows not the pot, 
And what's this pot? 
With what a pang one leaves so many a spot, 
'Twould be my death upon the spot! 
What does he want in this holy spot? 
Show me the fruits that, ere they're gathered, rot, 
And when thou in the feeling wholly blessed art, 
I'll play the comedy with art. 
To me it is a proper art 
We'll spread this cloak with proper art, 
  Sweet innocent, thou art! 
                  Ah, rogue! a tease thou art: 
My Margaret, see! still young thou art, 
Foreboding angel that thou art! 
Why, on the whole, thou'rt--what thou art. 
And thou remainest--what thou art. 
To see him now I have no heart. 
With paragraphs all got by heart, 
And thy heart 
Vast as it is, fill with that force thy heart, 
Something beneath thy heart, 
And do I ask, wherefore my heart 
And from my heart. 
             Dearest man! I love thee from my heart. 
And in his presence stifled seems my heart. 
It stabbed me to the very heart. 
My very heart 
Why some inexplicable smart 
But not the least bit shrewd or smart, 
                  A moment, ere we part! 
Perhaps you'll warmly take their part? 
Prepare beforehand for your part 
What am I, then, if 'tis denied my part 
He must not unconsoled depart. 
When thou from honor didst depart 
How shall we leave the house, and start? 
Now where, just tell me, is there better sport? 
They dance, they chat, they cook, they drink, they court: 
Not only cold, amazed acquaintance yield'st, 
Here to the altar cam'st, 
Thine earthly self behind thee cast, 
I have not snares around thee cast; 
Even all the misery on him cast 
              A beast! 
First, to encounter the beast, 
Inspect him close: for what tak'st thou the beast? 
Impertinent beast! 
'Tis the absurdest, drollest beast. 
To be far beastlier than any beast. 
Long since: yet deemed him not important in the least. 
Come, follow us! Come here, at least! 
Take the brush here, at least, 
You'll let me triumph with a swelling breast: 
With brazen forehead, daring breast? 
Get me a kerchief from her breast,-- 
mighty love is in her breast. 
How fares the heart within your breast? 
Leaps, maddened, into the abyss's breast! 
Fails to subdue the tumult of his breast. 
     A cross upon his breast. 
But grantest, that in her profoundest breast 
Gulps the wild Moment in its greedy breast; 
Why is my heart so anxious, on thy breast? 
That, like a vulture, feeds upon thy breast! 
A maid that, even from my breast, 
Then show'st me mine own self, and in my breast 
Two souls, alas! reside within my breast, 
Who traps the Devil, hold him fast! 
come! to this!--Treacherous, contemptible spirit, and thou hast 
at last,-- 
But see! He's dead therefrom, at last. 
They will even say, at last, 
The shameless murderers praised at last! 
Nay, sheathe thy sword at last! 
One step, and thou art free at last! 
O yes, up to the stars at last! 
And elbows planted as in boast: 
With brimming glass that spilled the toast, 
O, let the past be past! 
Listen, my friend: the ages that are past 
The silvery phantoms of the ages past, 
From Earth the highest raptures and the best, 
One impulse art thou conscious of, at best; 
Thou'rt like the Spirit which thou comprehendest, 
Gossip! the times thou badly comprehendest: 
'Twere better if for novelties thou sendest: 
Thou, who around the wide world wendest, 
Among Thy menials, now, my face Thou findest. 
And ask us how we do, in manner kindest, 
Hear, hear! A flea! D'ye rightly take the jest? 
The gentleman is pleased to jest. 
Death is desired, and Life a thing unblest! 
To thee, of all earth's sons the poorest, dullest! 
Around me here, of spirit-presence fullest? 
     There was a rat in the cellar-nest, 
And if thou'rt moved to speak in earnest, 
Thou darest not tell me so in earnest. 
What need, that after words thou yearnest? 
To plague my day auspicious thou returnest. 
That thou manur'st the acre which thou reapest;-- 
Whereby for eighty years thy youth thou keepest! 
Thou art a man among the rest. 
As here of Schwerdtlein's death and place of rest? 
From here to eternal rest: 
Take hold, then! let reflection rest, 
The monster without air or rest, 
And now, away! Thou dar'st not rest. 
From ashy rest 
The day dawns: Dearest! Dearest! 
Amused us hast, on the mountain's crest, 
     He now was wholly drest-- 
Half conscious of his frenzied, crazed unrest, 
With all you gentlemen, the name's a test, 
I am not one of the greatest, 
Thee into the mob thou hatest! 
Brides only, and the sweetest! 
And prospects the completest! 
A welcome, but also a silent, guest. 
And yet is never Death a wholly welcome guest. 
I call a flea a tidy guest. 
     He had a paunch beneath his vest 
          In ribbons, wreath, and gayest vest 
So fain I stay, when thou delayest! 
If longer here thou stayest, 
Dust shall he eat, and with a zest, 
And Honor's godlike zest, 
And plunge into the world with zest! 
     With powerful fist: 
The time is long: thou need'st not now insist. 
"For God's sake," others to assist. 
No--no! The Devil is an egotist, 
thou canst not carry it out? Wilt fly, and art not secure against 
To reach the seller's box, a fighting host, 
        My thought is lost, 
To get a ticket break their necks almost.

Of books worm-eaten, gray with dust, 
And strike them into dust!

Then I suggest, 'twere fair and just 
To spare the lovely day your lust,

You'll then work on, because you must. 
Had not enough, to thrust 
But 'tis not meant to thrust 
Against the smoky paper thrust,-- 
You are not miserly, I trust? 
With resolute, courageous trust 
Yet, wilt thou to me entrust 
No, not a word. I go so little out. 
Come out! Come out! 
     And he'll work himself out.

By the chimney out! 
        He drained it at every bout: 
Off and about, 
MEPHISTOPHELES (_prying about_) 
     Take heed--look about! 
     He ran around, he ran about, 
        As oft as he drank thereout. 
     He gnawed and scratched the house throughout. 
     To leave the kettle, and singe the Frau! 
          Adieu! 
With power to feel and to enjoy it. Thou 
Ha! know'st thou me? Abomination, thou! 
her? Who was it that plunged her into ruin? I, or thou? 
E'er understood by such as thou? 
Where art thou? 
The restless, ruddy gold hast thou, 
     Knowest and fearest thou 
     Base Being, hearest thou? 
What murmurest thou? 
With what a feeling, thou great man, must thou 
Broomstick, you! 
As warmer life in every limb had crowned you; 
And you? 
Fair lady, let it not offend you, 
That arm and escort I would lend you! 
All Heaven descends, and opens bright around you! 
But something new must then requite you. 
With what a vintage can I serve you? 
Sir Doctor, it is good of you, 
It but depends upon the like of you, 
Allow me that my album first I reach you,-- 
Grant me this favor, I beseech you! 
Is, I perceive, a principle with you. 
That I could not be angrier with you. 
I would, myself, change rings with you. 
Your lungs, till breath and being fail you: 
Sweep down, and with their barb√©d points assail you; 
Tokay shall flow at once, to fill you! 
Fill up my glass with sweetest, will you? 
At once confide all others in you. 
Hear one strong word that might explain you. 
Pardon! With many questions I detain you. 
The rest a bold address will win you; 
Wilt thou grasp the thunder? Well that it has not been given to you, 
This, aged Sirs, belongs to you, 
Here is the genuine path for you; 
If not a husband, then a beau for you! 
Hang on your bosom and caress you; 
When foes in combat sorely press you; 
That now I vanish, pardon, I entreat you! 
When I upon the Blocksberg meet you, 
And what you'd like I'll undertake to get you. 
Who wouldn't lose his heart, that met you? 
How can a further test delight you? 
     Apples have been desired by you, 
And what will _you_? 
For Devils and for spectres this is law: 
Where they have entered in, there also they withdraw. 
All the repulsive cheats I view,-- 
But what comes sneaking, there, to view? 
He spake: "That is the proper view,-- 
How shall we plan, that all be fresh and new,-- 
     In thine own bosom build it anew! 
A game whose winnings no man ever knew,-- 
     There lies the brew! 
And such, forthwith, I'd have you brew. 
     Dame Baubo first, to lead the crew! 
     To the singing of thy crew. 
On your behalf, here, in my bosom grew; 
     Since first in Paradise they grew; 
How? 
How? 
     Ow! ow! ow! ow! 
Before which they bow, 
With such advantages endow! 
(_She opens the window_) 
MARTHA (_at the window_) 
MARGARET (_at the window_) 
        The pots before my window, 
When I am present she's impressed, she knows not how; 
Yes, your discourses, with their glittering show, 
To give his sweetheart a diverting show. 
Then a great public you can show. 
Had I a certificate to show! 
There's nothing special of my own to show! 
But on a gala-day one may his orders show. 
Are more than magic's empty show. 
Such an enamored fool in air would blow 
What once you did at a single blow, 
Are unrefreshing as the winds that blow 
        Into the tide below. 
The square below 
VOICE (_from below_) 
VOICE (_from below_) 
VOICE (_below_) 
HALF-WITCH (_below_) 
        And the magic flow 
Dare such a human voice disturb the flow, 
And the streets overflow: 
Thy nerves of touch ecstatic glow! 
The moon's lone disk, with its belated glow, 
The threefold dazzling glow! 
With light of power my soul shall glow, 
Obscuring Heaven's clear glow. 
Mark how, beneath the evening sunlight's glow, 
And meanwhile thou, alone, mayst glow 
So many a midnight,--would thy glow 
        And drank the last life-glow; 
Cease to bark and bellow! 
Woe's me, the fearful bellow! 
Such a noisy, disturbing fellow 
Bring cotton, quick! He's split my ears, that fellow. 
            As goes the crowd, I follow. 
     Hear I noises? songs that follow? 
     Of old days, come faint and hollow. 
     Stream and streamlet seek the hollow. 
We'll saunter to the Mill, in yonder hollow. 
As wife and child, as knave and plow! 
Yet, hast thou food which never satiates, now,-- 
                    Delay, now! 
Away, now! 
And both your ravens, where are _they_ now? 
And now-- 
Then you have reached the right place now. 
Where is our couple now? 
But what has happened, tell me now? 
     Alone, old Baubo's coming now; 
What hinders me from smiting now 
Look out, I'll smoke them now! 
And if the Earth don't open now 
The sign witness now, 
She feels that surely I'm a genius now,-- 
And even the fir-tree feels it now: 
Out of the cellar-door, just now. 
Once many a bit we sponged, but now, 
'Tis verily full many a day now. 
Ha! ha! That's just your way, I know: 
Full many a pleasant place I know, 
     And I am moved with joy, to know 
Wait not to know 
Wait not to know 
Ah, that simplicity and innocence ne'er know 
When I the starry courses know, 
Of saying the things I do not know,-- 
Days will be spent to bid you know, 
And there's a neat romance, completed ere you know! 
Upon my path I wish for frost and snow. 
Of name, and fame, and laurelled brow! 
A thousand germs break forth and grow, 
     That such within my garden grow. 
To grub with yearning force through Earth's dark marrow, 
Compress the six days' work within thy bosom narrow,-- 
The highest, lowest forms my soul shall borrow, 
Thou must begin to-morrow 
        What woe, what woe and sorrow 
Shall heap upon itself their bliss and sorrow, 
The work of sorrow! 
        I sat, in utter sorrow, 
        Where'er I go, what sorrow, 
Our shoes are all danced out, we trow, 
     The damn√©d beast--the curs√©d sow! 
     She rides upon a farrow-sow. 
No longer guest-right I bestow; 
He shall not leave alive, I vow. 
Why, then will I myself, I vow, 
I notice no such thing, I vow! 
Not if he had them by the neck, I vow, 
I'd like to leave it, I must avow; 
     From five and six 
The gentle movement of Thy Day. 
I feel that men are ripe for Judgment-Day, 
     And driven at last, in open day, 
And is as whimsical as on Creation's day. 
Are bright as on the earliest day. 
She walks abroad unveiled by day, 
And she recovered, then, so slowly, day by day. 
All hearts that beat beneath the heavenly day-- 
Then at the Doctors'-banquet I, to-day, 
It's true, Sibylla said, to-day. 
That thus you condescend, to-day, 
We're for the Hunters' lodge, to-day. 
Carousing, to-day! 
We passed, without a call, to-day. 
Who was that gentleman, to-day. 
But then, reflect: the mountain's magic-mad to-day, 
He's surely not alone to-day: 
Is't not enough, that what I speak to-day 
Sons of Mieding, rest to-day! 
Might have the most genteel society to-day! 
  Shall be for me a harvest-day! 
And then a chance will come, a holiday, 
Here, for the folk, each day's a holiday: 
Proclaimed the Spring's rejoicing holiday; 
Oberon, the beauteous fay, 
Left me lie in the straw where I lay. 
So weak and miserable she lay; 
     Fell on the hearth, and squirming lay, 
The lark sends down his flickering lay,-- 
And here, on my right breast, my baby lay! 
Brass, marble, parchment, paper, clay? 
     In the damp moss and clay:_ 
     'Tis made of clay, 
'Tis no companion of Delay. 
Is such delight, my steps would fain delay. 
And supping there with Hans occasioned your delay? 
Out with your spit, without delay! 
Through this insane, chaotic play? 
With much delight I see the play, 
Is't but masquerading play? 
And it will seem a mocking play, 
But evil tongues in this town have full play. 
No, it is just in play. 
True, child is child, and play is play. 
As in a love-adventure they might play! 
Or, at the best, a Punch-and-Judy play, 
O yes, the gentleman finds it all child's-play! 
When, piece by piece, can one the things abroad display, 
But let her growth and strength display, 
The first was not a great display. 
Why should I fly? They'll still my steps waylay! 
But stipulating, that I may 
Most willingly, to what extent I may. 
And one becomes the talk, do whatsoe'er one may. 
     But howsoe'er she hasten may, 
Since from the devils I also may 
        Splendid the pay! 
        Splendid the pay! 
And more than ever we must pay! 
Promised them fullest heavenly pay, 
Misty vale and mountain gray, 
Continue, pray! 
How is't with thy religion, pray? 
But with the grapes how was it, pray? 
Ask you, pray? 
My friend, take proper heed, I pray! 
Give me a line or two, I pray. 
But not too very far, I pray! 
Sir Doctor, don't retreat, I pray! 
Wherefrom the fountain flings eternal spray, 
Like gossiping of war, and war's array, 
        In Beauty's array, 
The look, the manner, both betray-- 
The sweet young maiden to betray, 
A highly-learned man, to stray. 
She haunts her window, watching clouds that stray 
What! whirled so far astray? 
What wilt from me, Base Spirit, say?-- 
     Dear son, I say, 
How has he helped the town, I say? 
     And measure his coat, I say! 
And stroking then my beard, I'd say, 
Go to the River Tavern, I should say. 
He'll be with Curly-head, I heard him say. 
Draw power, whose measure none can say; 
"I believe in God!" to say? 
Then stand abashed, when thou art forced to say: 
Shall one believe no miracles, just say! 
I'd something give, could I but say 
Each in its language--say; 
An't please thee, also I'm content to stay, 
You meet by accident; you feel, you stay, 
Rejoiced am I that I may stay! 
The little god o' the world sticks to the same old way, 
     Man in one leap has cleared the way. 
And if a will-o'-the-wisp must guide you on the way, 
What need to shorten so the way? 
Then house-right I must use, and clear the way. 
To manage witches, this is just the way. 
Has still an instinct of the one true way. 
Before the Thunder's crashing way: 
Back from the last, the solemn way. 
"Each well enough in her own way. 
And yet, I think, dost not incline that way. 
Why do you go that way? 
But then, it's not a pleasant way. 
Now quick, away! 
Since to the lees _my_ cask is drained away, 
And she of him. So runs the world away! 
In all its tides sweeps not the world away, 
Of yearning onward, upward and away, 
Up and away! 
And will her foul mess take away 
And me a little away, 
It seems the mistress has gone away? 
        Marching away! 
VOICE (_from within, dying away_) 
And that a poodle ran away? 
I cannot really go away: 
When down in Turkey, far away, 
O'er the old city-wall, and far away. 
  He's only glad who gives away: 
To let thee see how smooth life runs away. 
At the first glance who sees it runs away. 
Said he: "When I from Malta went away 
                    Ay! we must away. 
     Keep thou away! 
     Fly away! Fly away_! 
Remains there naught of lofty spirit-sway, 
     The tailor came straightway: 
Off in the world he went straightway,-- 
As if the Holy Host came by. 
FAUST MARGARET _(passing by)_ 
     The wind is hushed, the star shoots by. 
The one who just went by. 
But let me suckle, first, my baby! 
We've too much tact and policy 
They never yet have been so pert and saucy. 
You face it out, impertinent and heady? 
Just wait! a shower of blows is ready. 
That it hath scented me already: 
Perceiv'st thou yonder snail? It cometh, slow and steady; 
A gray and wrinkled noddy; 
How sadly rises, incomplete and ruddy, 
And show a strapping body. 
'Tis winter still within my body: 
Let Poetry your will obey! 
And deeply edified were they. 
To follow servant-girls, when they 
Most wise! And first, of course, we'll make the journey 
For my Italian journey. 
Some outlines of the tourney; 
We made a Turkish merchantman our prey, 
We must make use of strategy. 
And even, alas! Theology,-- 
Who towards me pressed with all thine energy? 
Round all, in wrathful energy. 
I've studied now Philosophy 
There, now, is thine antipathy! 
The Holy Church has a stomach healthy: 
And viewed it with a favor stealthy. 
Have, from this desk, seen climb the sky 
     Break from the sky! 
Darting hither from the sky, 
Till darkness closes from the sky! 
     The dreary moon forsakes the sky; 
Once more, my friend, thou talkest sensibly. 
     Pierced irredressibly! 
     Named inexpressibly, 
It much becomes thee to be raving madly. 
Thy head is out of order, sadly: 
Assuredly. 
(_They drink repeatedly_.) 
(FAUST _looks around wildly_.) 
And, if you'll probe the thing profoundly, 
Knew you so much--and you'll confess it roundly!-- 
And old ones, veiled and hidden shrewdly: 
And I shall try to serve you nicely. 
On my account be kind, nor treat them rudely! 
A bit of purgatory 'twas for this time, merely. 
All that is promised shall delight thee purely; 
Made with you gentlemen--and binding,--surely? 
You mustn't take things too precisely. 
Good Sir, you see the facts precisely 
We must arrange them now, more wisely, 
THE WITCH (_laughs immoderately_) 
A girl that takes my heart, completely. 
This first line let me weigh completely, 
I've everywhere, in fact, been entertained politely. 
Behold my wares attentively: 
To his neck will I fly, 
But come, away! 'Tis time for us to fly; 
     The cook laid poison cunningly, 
He looks around so sneeringly, 
Which Nature portions out so lovingly-- 
Yes, he deserves your favor thoroughly,-- 
And of a noble family; 
The art is old and new, for verily 
I see one yonder, burning merrily. 
Tis magic all, thou fool, seduced so easily! 
He rises mightily: 
                         And heartily! 
His pink of girls right lustily, 
(_He takes_ SIEBEL _by the nose: the others do the same reciprocally, 
And had I not the Flame reserved, why, really, 
Note her especially, 
Find'st nothing right on earth, eternally? 
In dry, and wet, and warm, and chilly; 
     So cannibalic jolly! 
Must play the Devil again, and fully. 
Will have it, certainly. 
And is it thou? Thou, surely, certainly? 
I locked the press, most certainly. 
        To see him, him only, 
        To meet him, him only, 
Upon my brow, in Sabbath silence holy; 
That her salvation is,--with scruples holy 
A good reply! 
The Mighty Spirit deigns me no reply, 
What mean you? Wait!--you'll pay for't dearly! 
        Grave, and all-gloriously 
        Has He, victoriously, 
Then, too, when night descends, how anxiously 
Grasp me not so murderously! 
Those, dressed so prettily and neatly. 
Lest my impatient pen proceed too fleetly. 
I think we'd better send him packing quietly. 
With one begin'st thou secretly, 
I mean, have you not felt desire, though ne'er so slightly? 
It may be that your eyes deceive you slightly; 
A streaming trail of fire, if I see rightly, 
    And so, at last, it serves her rightly. 
She clung to the fellow so long and tightly! 
Why heat thyself, thus instantly, 
his hand. _FAUST_ turns impatiently_.) 
Seize me not thus so violently! 
Himself a whole so frequently, 
I praise the old ones, not unduly: 
'Twere easier groping forward, truly. 
Why, Zounds! Both hands and feet are, truly-- 
When we were all-in-all, then, truly, 
     Do thy bidding, guide us truly, 
     We, it seems, have entered newly 
Yet all that I indulge in newly, 
How this pure soul, of faith so lowly, 
And, filled with mystic presage, chimed the church-bell slowly, 
And then, how masterly she reads physiognomy! 
Only by mass you touch the mass; for any 
Who offers much, brings something unto many, 
That thou art in such company. 
With proved adepts in company, 
Is't not sufficient company? 
     Living knots and gnarls uncanny 
Within my press! Of ebony,-- 
Beside the good Saint Antony, 
Than in the year's monotony. 
Twas Perseus lopped it, her old adversary. 
Or from behind struck down the adversary. 
No sword, but severed ties for the unwary, 
For there arises now a murderous cry. 
That is all the scenery. 
Needless your machinery: 
Shall I outlive this misery? 
Almighty God! what misery! 
And this one Book of Mystery 
Is always for the wise, no less than fools, a mystery. 
Follows his path of mystery. 
Suggest their own delivery; 
Among this witches' revelry 
Ah, not alone the jewelry! 
What! Not a pocket-piece? no jewelry? 
Henry! Henry! 
Promise me, Henry!-- 
This drear, accursed masonry, 
Thus shall you hit the mark of gain and glory. 
Seek to confound your auditory! 
Such time I've squandered o'er the history: 
So delicately its feelers pry, 
It's as if nobody had nothing to fetch and carry, 
     Fragments into the Void we carry, 
Her head beneath her arm she'll sometimes carry; 
Alas, that trade and duty us so harry! 
You've but to lunge, and I will parry. 
I'd ask you, longer here to tarry, 
And dares not even now and then to tarry! 
Stand by: I'll lead, if you'll but tarry: 
Reason becomes a sham, Beneficence a worry: 
Yet I would take again, and willing, all the worry, 
But now my days have less of noise and hurry; 
This to consider, there's, alas! no hurry. 
I cannot here disguise me, if I try. 
They gladly hearken, prompt for injury,-- 
To grasp the spirit of Medicine is easy: 
Why, 'twas a real ecstasy! 
I now am conscious. With this ecstasy, 
Such works are held as antiquate and mossy; 
        Castles, with lofty 
No beastliness and no stupidity. 
Take notice, first! their bestiality 
And I, as suits their quality, 
Blood is a juice of rarest quality. 
Since all that's coarse provokes my enmity. 
For thou hast no Christianity. 
The highest right, supreme Humanity, 
And also made their opportunity. 
  A holiday, that shows your pity, 
If _I_ should choose to preach Posterity, 
The right born with us, ours in verity, 
Yet choose thyself a faculty! 
As though my legs were four-and-twenty. 
The temple-halls of Certainty. 
How from the window of the sacristy 
  Let me not vainly sing my ditty; 
Enjoy the rich, the ever-living Beauty! 
Metaphysics learn the use and beauty! 
But ye, God's sons in love and duty, 
A word steps promptly in as deputy.
