 
 
A yearning long unfelt, each impulse swaying, 
And names the dear ones, they whom Fate bereaving 
And visions fair of many a blissful day; 
As erst upon my troubled sight ye stole; 
As upward from the vapoury mist ye roll; 
Back o'er life's devious labyrinthine way, 
Dispersed the throng, their severed flight now winging; 
E'en their applause is to my heart a pang; 
Fann'd by the magic breath your march surrounding. 
Fans the Aeolian harp, my numbers roll; 
First-love and friendship their fond accents blending, 
For stranger crowds the Orphean lyre now stringing, 
If yet they live, now wander widely parted. 
In faltering cadence, as when Zephyr playing, 
Like to some ancient, half-expiring lay; 
Mute are the voices that responsive rang. 
Of life's fair hours, left me behind them grieving. 
Of old who listened to my song, glad hearted, 
 
Shades fondly loved appear, your train attending, 
Shall I this time attempt to clasp, to hold ye? 
Sorrow revives, her wail of anguish sending 
Still for the fond illusion yearns my soul? 
Tear follows tear, my steadfast heart obeying 
The souls to whom my earlier lays I sang; 
The tender impulse, loses its control; 
 
They hear me not my later cadence singing, 
Those I have lost become realities to me. 
To yon calm spirit-realm uplifts my soul; 
What I possess as from afar I see; 
Within my breast youth's throbbing pulse is bounding, 
YE wavering shapes, again ye do enfold me, 
Ye press around! Come then, your captive hold me,
