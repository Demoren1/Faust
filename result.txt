As upward from the vapoury mist ye roll;  65   3 
And names the dear ones, they whom Fate bereaving  65   4 
And visions fair of many a blissful day;  65   5 
A yearning long unfelt, each impulse swaying,  65   6 
As erst upon my troubled sight ye stole;  65   7 
Back o'er life's devious labyrinthine way,  66   8 
Dispersed the throng, their severed flight now winging;  68   9 
E'en their applause is to my heart a pang;  69  10 
First-love and friendship their fond accents blending,  70  11 
For stranger crowds the Orphean lyre now stringing,  70  12 
Fann'd by the magic breath your march surrounding.  70  13 
Fans the Aeolian harp, my numbers roll;  70  14 
If yet they live, now wander widely parted.  73  15 
In faltering cadence, as when Zephyr playing,  73  16 
Like to some ancient, half-expiring lay;  76  17 
Mute are the voices that responsive rang.  77  18 
Of old who listened to my song, glad hearted,  79  19 
Of life's fair hours, left me behind them grieving.  79  20 
Shades fondly loved appear, your train attending,  83  21 
Sorrow revives, her wail of anguish sending  83  22 
Still for the fond illusion yearns my soul?  83  23 
Shall I this time attempt to clasp, to hold ye?  83  24 
To yon calm spirit-realm uplifts my soul;  84  25 
Tear follows tear, my steadfast heart obeying  84  26 
The tender impulse, loses its control;  84  27 
They hear me not my later cadence singing,  84  28 
Those I have lost become realities to me.  84  29 
The souls to whom my earlier lays I sang;  84  30 
What I possess as from afar I see;  87  31 
Within my breast youth's throbbing pulse is bounding,  87  32 
YE wavering shapes, again ye do enfold me,  89  33 
Ye press around! Come then, your captive hold me,  89  34
